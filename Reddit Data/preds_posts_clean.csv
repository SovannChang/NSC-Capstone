70,70,6bqxqk,An Open Letter to Fans of the Nashville Predators,"Dear Predators fans,

You don't know me, and you probably don't like me. I'm a Blackhawks fan, and have been at least a casual fan since 2009 or so, and a diehard since 2014. I've seen the Blackhawks do all sorts of insane shit in the playoffs--from winning triple overtime games, to three cups in six seasons, to getting stonewalled by a white-hot goaltender (Mike Smith, 2012), to being absolutely massacred by a team we thought we'd destroy (Nashville, 2017). 

But I'm here to say a few things:

1. This is a special, special team. I've never, not in my hockey-watching lifetime, seen a team so thoroughly dominate their opponents. Even when trailing, I've never seen a team with so much speed, so much fire to not fucking quit. I've never seen someone get inside the head of my own captain so thoroughly as PK Subban did. I've never seen a goalie so thoroughly smother damn near every shot the way Rinne did. I've never seen a defense fly the way I watch Subban, Ellis, Ekholm, Josi, Weber, and Irwin just shred through. I've never seen a team move so fast-seriously. Every game I've seen, especially during the Hawks series, Nashville has been moving so fast and with such fluidity they make it seem like there's nine guys on the ice. Even after Fiala went down, the forwards were unlike anything I've ever seen--Arvidsson, Forsberg, Fisher, Neal, Johansen...holy fuck. I don't know what sort of voodoo insanity Laviolette and co. are working, but it's basically destroying everyone in the West and I don't know that either team in the East stands even half a chance.

2. You're in for a good, good few years. A quick look at CapFriendly reveals something startling: yall have 3.5 million in cap space this season, and are kicking Ribeiro's ass to the curb at the end of the season. Not only that, but (from what I can gather, I don't watch the Predators much) your only significant re-signing is Arvidsson. Other than that, you've got your core locked down for years. ***YEARS.*** And this is a relatively young team, too. I keep forgetting, personally, that Josi is only 26 because it seems like he's been fucking shit up for other teams for years and years. This team, provided Poile isn't a dipshit (and considering he flipped Weber for Subban one for one, plus he doesn't hand out NMCs and NTCs like candy [looking at you, Stan Bowman], I really do think he's one of the best GMs in the league by far) will be in contention for a long, long, long time, especially if you guys can find a suitable replacement for Rinne. And that's scary as fuck.

3. I know the sort of ride you're on in the playoffs right now. I've been there before, and it's *fun as fuck.* There's really, genuinely nothing better than seeing your team dominate for the most part in the playoffs. There's nothing quite like seeing your team, even in dark moments, pull through. There's a certain comfort that comes in knowing that your team is gonna pull it off--one that even when you're down 2-1 late in the third, where you can just feel the tying goal coming--that's so liberating. This is a team that looks like it's having fun on the ice, genuine, hard-working fun. And that, to me, is the sign of a team that's got what it takes to run all the way to hoisting Lord Stanley's Cup. The Predators are on fire in a way I can't quite summarize. There's a certain lightness to the way they conduct themselves after the games, a confidence that just screams that this is a team that can do it. 

4. What an incredible organization and crowd you guys have. The crowd in Nashville, at Bridgestone...holy fuck. What a crowd. All those chants, how choreographed, how loud and in unison, just the energy running through the building. I've never seen anything like it, even in the United Center. The way the Predators organization has built such a dedicated, loving fanbase in a southern market, one that's become a true hockey market, just leaves me in awe. How the Nashville community is getting behind the Predators-from Lady Antebellum and Carrie Underwood singing the national anthem, to the Titans players making appearances--it's so awesome to watch, seriously. It's fun, and truly incredible.

In the end, this is a team that I love. It's one that I'll cheer for till the bitter--or sweet-- end of the playoffs. I'm not supposed to say that--we're division rivals, we got murdered by Nashville, yada yada yada. I don't give a fuck. I'm rooting my brains out for Nashville, and the Predators are a team that's really earned my respect and admiration in so many ways. This is a special team, a special organization, in a special city, surrounded by a special culture, and blessed with some truly, truly special fans. I can say with full and total confidence that I've never had a bad experience with a Predators fan. Every single one of you here and on /r/hockey has been absolutely wonderful. You're passionate, you're knowledgeable, and you cheer hard as hell for a team that deserves every fucking ounce of support it gets. You've earned a new (if temporary, because my Blackhawks will always come first, no matter what) fan through these playoffs, and one who wishes nothing but the absolute best as well as many cups to you.

Signed,

That made me sit down and think about my gameday choices. So everyone, please plan ahead. If you’re going to drink, make sure you have a ride. Play it safe and drink in moderation. Rule of thumb is to give yourself an hour to sober up from each drink. Also, if you have a long drive like me remember that being drowsy is like being drunk. Take a nap at a rest stop or gas station if you need to. 

We have the best sports family in the world. That because we have the best fans, the best arena, the best employees, and the best city. So let’s take care of each other. Go Preds. ",Unknown,2018-04-12 20:31:03

Saros is legit. We have legitimate prospects that could make an impact next year. Players will be more adjusted to the new system under Hynes. All of these things combined and we're going to be a legitimate threat instead of a bubble team.

I'm really proud of this team and what they managed to do this series and this season. It was one of the more fun playoffs in recent memory (especially compared to last year) and I'm proud of the boys for the way they left it on the ice.

I'm looking forward to a strong Preds team coming back next year.",bobadoot,2021-05-28 04:38:40

So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but Viktor fucking Arvidsson himself. I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Arvi, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Viktor put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt.

I've spent the last few years in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire regular season watching Erat play average hockey in the KHL it's just not fair.
 
If the Caps lose again in the second round I will face that the Caps didn't actually need him and the trade wasn't an accident, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the Caps and the NHL.",lawtosstoss,2017-04-26 16:25:08

Everyone around us were asking where we were from, giving us food recommendations, etc. I guess everyone seems nice because Sharks fans are all snooty rich boys from South Bay (source: am a Sharks fan from East Bay.)

445,445,6bn0mp,If anyone knows (or is) the guy who gave his section 105 seats up to me and my son...,"I wish I would have gotten your name. This was my five year old son's first Predators game. He watches nearly every game on tv and has been begging me to go since last season. 

We were heading towards our seats at the very top of 308 when a guy asked if we wanted to sit at the bottom level because he ended up getting suite tickets from his company. I had no idea they were 5 rows from the glass. He would have been happy anywhere but this experience was magical for him. He told me three times it was the best night of his life. He even got a puck from a player during warm ups. 

I wasn't sure how my (normally in bed by 8:00pm) son would handle the whole game. But he was screaming and cheering until the very end.  He said his favorite part was when he got to do the ""hands up song"" because that meant the Predators won. 

So if you know a guy who gave his seats up to the 5 year old with the mohawk. Tell him he made that kids entire year. 

This is the first time I've gone to a game with the perspective of having to entertain a young child. The Predators really are top notch in fan entertainment. I love the Titans but they could really take some pointers from the Preds organization. ",panphobia,2017-05-17 06:23:08

587,587,84gr27,My experience at a Preds game,"A few weeks ago I made a trip to Nashville to just see the area and try the food. It happened that the Predators were playing the Sharks one of the nights I was there, so it was an easy decision to go.

I'm actually a Penguins fan but always enjoy checking out other team’s arenas and what the game experience is like. 

I've been to a Hurricanes, Rangers, Devils, Islanders, Sabres, and Penguins home game. 
I've been to many basketball games as well (Knicks, Nets, Hornets, Hawks, Suns).
I have never had as much fun as I did the night the Preds played the Sharks. Sure, it was a massacre (8-1 win I believe), but the crowd chants were unreal. I was in section 302 (or 303) and they had sheets of paper they handed to new fans, so they could cheer/jeer along.
The arena was loud the entire time and the fans engaged the entire time. Hearing unique chanting in unison was one of the coolest experiences I've ever seen in all games from all sports I've been to.
When I returned home, the Preds/Blues game was on TV and I listened for, and heard, the same chants in the background. Super cool to hear.

The city is beautiful. Broadway felt like bourbon street lite. Great music from local bands, great food, and friendly people.

Having just known of the predators as one of the more recent expansion teams, I never saw them as this franchise that was a regular in NHL lore.
Of course, watching the Stanley Cup last season piqued my interest, but being there in person and experiencing your amazing city sheds a whole new light on the team and the whole area.

I'll always pull for the Penguins first but if it's not us, I hope it's you. Keep up the great work of being a loyal and amazing fanbase.",King4Day,2018-03-14 20:40:12

630,630,7d7ojr,You guys are awesome.,"Me and a friend, both from Montreal, spent the last 5 days in Nashville and got lucky enough to attend Saturday's game against the Pens. He's a Habs fan and I'm a Sens fan (grew up close to Ottawa) and we both agreed, Saturday was the best in-house game experience we ever had for a regular season game, and we both attended plenty games in Montreal and Ottawa.

From the chants in the crowd to the school band playing live music during intermission instead of the stupid gimmicky stuff we usually get, this truly was an awesome experience. I must admit we came in with our Canadian prejudices, thinking hockey in the South was not such a big thing and people wouldn't care that much about what was happening on the ice, but we couldn't have been more further from the truth. People around us were following all the action, were super into it, and really knowledgeable about the team since we got a chance to chat with some people around us who were kinda curious as who were the two guys speaking French in their section.

We couldn't have expected a better outcome as well. While having our pre-game drink at Yazoo (Hop Perfect is fucking awesome btw), we were discussing how me, as a Sens fans, wanted Turris to do well in his first game with you and how he, as a Habs fan who never accepted the fact that his team traded Subban, wanted him to score a goal. Well, we both got what we were wishing for, and got an incredible game as well going in the SO with the Preds beating a team we both hate. A night to remember for sure.

And if this was not already enough, you exit the arena and you are right on Broadway street, super energized from the game you just attended, and now you get carried away in all the bars with all the live music and the beautiful women that are at every single place.

Honestly Preds fans I'm jealous. You have an incredible team and and incredible city as well. This was my second time visiting and I will definitely come back sooner than later. You guys are now officially my favorite Western team and I hope we can meet in the final. Would the Sens lose against you, I wouldn't even be mad.

Thank you for the hospitality,

661,661,69a4kb,From a lifelong Blues fan to the Predators organization.,"This is my first time in this subreddit, but I felt like it was necessary after reading the most recent article about the Preds fundraiser for St. Louis flood relief.

I was born and raised in St. Louis, and other than a short stint away, I have lived here my entire life.  Our city has our problems.  A lot of them.  But I love my city.  Hockey is one of the few outlets that brings an otherwise divided city together.

One of the things our city has been fighting as of recent is the flooding.  It really has devastated a lot of families in the greater STL region.  The fact that your organization stepped up to support our city in the middle of a heated series shows what kind of club the Nashville Predators are.

You guys have played a solid series of hockey against us.  It's been gritty, fast, and fun to watch.  Everything you could ask for in a series.  If you guys move on to round 3, I hope that Lord Stanley blesses your club with a cup in the near future.  You guys deserve it.

So from one little ol' St. Louis local to the Preds organization, thank you for your support.  No matter how little or much you raise, the gesture of supporting us when we need it is a testament to what you stand for.

That being said, we'll see you tomorrow night and LET'S GO BLUES!!!",Sonikburn,2017-05-04 20:29:48

To Paul, thanks for wearing the greatest suits (sorry Don Cherry) and for being the best announcer of all! Lastly, to the entire organization and the city of Nashville, thank you for allowing me to be a fan of the greatest NHL fanbase and organization there is. I am truly grateful to wear a Preds jersey in 100 degree Florida (even though I'm a Smashville native) and for letting me be a part of something great.

The way your crowd gets into everything, and the depth of hockey knowledge from your fans made the experience tops. Thank you all for being so welcoming, especially the fans in 323 who chatted my wife and I up happily. Some good friendly banter, but everyone was mutually respectful. I think I've cemented my western conference team in my visit to your amazing city, team, and interactions with fans.

I happened upon tickets to the game Saturday night and I have to tell you, Nashville hands-down has the best gameday/arena experience I have ever been a part of. 

I go to mostly Pens and Bluejackets games, but I have been to plenty of games in Detroit, Philly, Chicago, and even a few out in Denver, LA, Anaheim, and San Jose. You guys blow them all out of the water. 

Your fans are fun people, at least they were to me.. and they know the game a hell of a lot better than the stereotypes would indicate. P.K.'s dad even told me I was in the wrong building, then gave me a smile and a handshake, and told me he hoped we were enjoying ourselves. 

Anyway, just wanted to stop in and tell you all how much fun I had. A hockey atmosphere like that always warms my heart, and I wish it was like that everywhere. Cheers, and I hope we meet again in the finals this year!",ChipsAndSmokesLetsGo,2017-11-13 20:24:59

863,863,bb8wuc,"A totally serious, comprehensive guide to the Nashville Predators and its super cereal community","Whether you're a bandwagon fan hitching a ride for the playoffs or a new fan entirely who is excited to witness playoff hockey, welcome! Im going to detail as much about this team as I can until I get bored of typing, which can happen pretty quickly sometimes. The aim of this is to try and help give newcomers an insight to our team and community and maybe persuade you to stick around for awhile. I encourage everyone to comment things I may have missed or things that they think are important.


Let's start. Here is a list of teams who we aren't particularly fond of.


Fuck the:


- Jets


- Ducks


- Hawks


- Penguins


- Avs


- Blues


- Wings


- Stars **


** Currently the biggest FUCK, they are our round 1 matchup.


Let's talk player nicknames. If you're new to Hockey, a lot of nicknames are just adding Y or R at the end of a shortened version of their name. Lots of creativity.


Filip Forsberg - Flip, Filthy Fil, The Swedish Prince, Scoresberg


Viktor Arvidsson - RV (Arvi, Arvy), Worlds Smallest Recreational Vehicle


Ryan Johansen - Joey, RyJo, Beautiful Person


Austin Watson - Watty, Toothless


Kyle Turris - The Great Him, TuChainz


Nick Bonino - Bones


Calle Jarnkrok - Jarny, Iron Hook


Rocco Grimaldi - Rocc'em Socc'em, Roccstar, Pocket Arvy


Colton Sissons - Sissors, Snossis, Hat Trick Sissons


Craig Smith - Smitty, Crazy Legs


Mikka Salomaki - Salty, Salami


Roman Josi - Jos, Captain, Attractiveness/60 Leader... Nightcrawler, if you're Willy Daunic.


Mattias Ekholm - Matty Ice, Swedish Redwood/Lumberjack, Ekky


Ryan Ellis - Elly, Captain Redbeard


PK Subban - I'm sure lots of teams have nicknames for him. But we just say PK or Subban


Dan Hamhuis - Hammer, Dan the Man


Brian Boyle - BOYLER, BIG BOYLE, ABSOLUTE UNIT BRIAN BOYLE (must use caps)


Cody McLeod - Cody McPylon


Mikael Granlund - Granny, Finnish Bay Jesus


Wayne Simmonds - Wayne Train, Simmer, The Simmulator


Dante Fabbro - Fabbrolous, Dante's Inferno, Fabbio


Pekka Rinne - Pekks, Papa Pekks, Vezina Trophy Winner Pekka Rinne


Juuse Saros - Juicy, Juice, Pocket Pekka, Lord Saros


Some have cool nicknames, some have the opposite. Let's cover traditions, which also covers controversy at the same time.


We throw catfish. Yes, you will see someone chuck a catfish onto the ice more than once. Similar to Detroit throwing an octopus onto the ice. You don't see it much in regular season, but you definitely will see it in the postseason. It should be noted that IF you intend to throw a catfish onto the ice, firstly make sure it's dead. Secondly, wait for a stoppage of play. While the image in my head of someone getting domed by a catfish is hilarious, it's dangerous to throw things while players are moving at speed. And lastly, catfish are instruments of crime, throwing them on the ice in other teams arenas will carry consequences.


We chant. I mean most sports have chanting crowds, except golf I guess. I don't know I never watched it. But what makes our chants special is that it hurts people's feelings. When we score a goal, we tell the goalie that he sucks, and that it is all his fault. When Paul announces the opposing starting lineup, we let them know they they suck. And their coach sucks too. When the other team goes on the powerplay, we let them know that they still suck. Honestly it's pretty tame, when is the last time you got mad when someone said ""You suck, bud""? As tame as it is, shit works. People hate it.


Now for Reddit traditions. After a win, there are a few things you'll see every time in the thread. I'm typing this on mobile, so I'm not going to bother trying to link things. In no particular order:


Victory Fish - A gif of a catfish, posted by u/Kroger453PredsFan


Highlights of the Game - Streamable links posted by u/vorin


Downvote Party - The only comment you'll downvote in a winning thread, posted by u/ClassicCarPhenatic


Tense Idiotic Asian Porcupine - Someone will lead off with Tense or a sentence containing the word, and each following comment will complete the sequence. At the end, a gif of Gnash pleasuring himself is posted.


I Like it, I love it - Similar to TIAP, someone will say a variation or ""I love it"" and the following comments complete the song.



If you're wondering which players you should watch out for, really it's all of them. The JOFA (Forsberg, Johansen, Arvidsson) line is talented and always working. The Production Line (Sissons, Bonino, Watson) was a standout line last postseason and since Watson's return, they look like they'll keep that up. The line I'm anticipating the most is the second line. The GURTH Line or Gran Turrismo Line, whichever you prefer. It's Mikael Granlund and Craig Smith centered by Kyle Turris. Kyle Turris has struggled all year to find his game, and Mikael Granlund hasn't been on his game either since we acquired him in a trade from Minnesota. The last week though, they have been knocking in the door. If there's a time for them to breakout, it's now. I would also keep an eye on our fourth line. Brian Boyle and Wayne Simmonds centered by Calle Jarnkrok. Brian Boyle has been an excellent addition since we got him, Calle Jarnkrok is a consistent player, and Wayne Simmonds is a veteran who has yet to find his stride with a new team. This is a great fourth line. This is a line that could also change depending on the style of play we need, but I doubt it changes much.


As for our defensive pairs, the only thing I'm looking for with the Top 4 is a return to solid defense, and it looks like we're trending that way. The third defensive pair consists of Dan Hamhuis and Dante Fabbro. This is the pair I'm most interested in because Fabbro is a rookie, having only played 4 games so far in the NHL. If you missed it, he had a monster goal last Saturday against Chicago that lit the arena on fire, it was awesome.


The number one thing I, and most people, want to see change with this team is the Powerplay. If you are unaware, we finished last in the league with out powerplay. Imagine if we had a good powerplay, that would be nice. If we can start capitalizing on the powerplay, we will be a force of nature.


That's all I've got for now. Again, I encourage everyone to share in the comments. If you're new to this team, speak up. Any questions will be answered.

955,955,11xp8nm,Oilers fan here in peace. Ekholm is an Absolute Stud,"As an Oilers fan, I had always known that Ekholm was a pretty good defenceman. I remember always trading for or signing him in NHL franchise mode and putting him on the second pairing as a good shutdown defenceman and being pretty happy with the results. But I didn’t expect him to come to E-town and be a goddamn stud. 

First and foremost, he has come in and completely stabilized the Oilers back end. He not only eats about 25 minutes a night and reduces the amount of ice time put on the other defencemen, but there has been a general effect on improving the defensive responsibility of the blue line as a whole. Evan Bouchard, who he has been partnered with since day 1, has completely taken off offensively and looks way more confident defensively. Not to mention other young dmen like Philip Broberg and Vincent Desharnais have looked way more calm and confident. 

As an added bonus, he has been a point-per-game player and has injected so much life into the offence. He had the game saving tying goal last night on a beauty of a clapper below the hash marks. This is just one example of how he seems to always know when to cheat for offence, and is never caught pinching at the wrong time.
Just one of many cases where he seemingly never makes an uncalculated error.

To be frank, I didn’t really know what to completely expect when we traded for him. He wasn’t really rumoured to go to Edmonton until a couple hours before he got traded. All of the rumours pointed to Chychrun or Gavrikov coming over. And admittedly, I was initially disappointed that we traded for Ekholm over Chychrun. But seeing how Ek has fit in seamlessly, I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

Filip Forsberg and Matt Duchene walked in the night before they played the stars and hung out together for a few hours at my bar and sat in the bar area for a bit. I immediately recognized them as soon as they walked in and, I ended up serving them. Forsberg nursed a few bud lights with the occasional crown shot and, Dutchy was drinking Titos & soda with cranberry. They couldn’t have been nicer.
They bought a few rounds for some other 
guests and danced with a few fellow patrons.
I ended up telling them I was a preds fan and they were ecstatic to talk hockey for a bit and even sign a predators hat I had retrieved from my car.
After 3 hours or so, they tipped me very well and, went on their way with a couple of other customers they met at the bar that night.

995,7,183omt4,Who is the Preds biggest rival right now?,"Was thinking about it this week. Over our team’s history, we’ve usually had at least one or multiple teams that the fanbase, and the players to an extent, absolutely could not stand.

• Detroit in the 2000s when they were in the Western Conf
• Chicago in the 2010s during their dynasty era
• Pittsburg & Winnipeg following the Cup run
• Dallas around the Winter Classic and playoff series

A lot of these rivalries are based on two factors: 
1. These opponents being really good/Cup contenders 
2. The Preds being consistently able to compete and sometimes upset them.

These past few seasons, mainly under Hynes, I feel like the Preds team lost that edge and that bite that they were known for, but it seems with all of the youth and new staff that it’s coming back!

So who do y’all see as our current biggest rival? Any other reasons why our rivalries have lost that edge? Maybe it’s just a Covid hangover as well.

Also, with Bedard in Chicago, will that hatred be reignited in the next few years?",ConBurgundy15,2023-11-25 17:22:30

1027,39,17yt0tb,New fan (UK),"Hi

I've decided to start watching NHL hockey after getting into the NHL the past year or so, after a few days of deciding which team to support I've landed on the Nashville predators.

I wanted to follow a team that had never won a Stanley cup, I liked their logo and I liked their colours and the predators won, the Sharks came close but I don't really like the colour teal.

So, I need your help, What is the state of play with the predators at the moment? Who are our best players?what does the future look like? Who are our rivals?

In football (soccer) I support Manchester United and in the NFL I support the saints.

Thanks",MUNOS85,2023-11-19 08:59:03

Saros has no replacement. Starting askarov will ruin him, starting lankinen will tank the team and slow down our skaters development.

Also Saros can't be one for one for mcdavid or draisaitl so we will have to give up glass, or evangilista, or forsberg, or Novak, or fabbro. Doing this would leave us with two ahl goalies, 0 forward core depth, and a bland defense. At which point we will be the Edmonton Oilers.",Rudmonton,2023-11-12 16:49:19

He's got 2 years left, we have Askarov coming up (probably around then), and our playoff outlook for the next two years is pretty slim so why hold onto such a high value piece?

Would be really painful to see him go but I think we could get some massive pieces for him and then we have Askarov to fill in behind him. Also, would be very sick to see Saros make a deep play with another team because he really has what it takes to pull a cup if he had a solid team in front of him.

How do yall feel about it? Anyone in mind that you'd trade him for?",jetnetni,2023-11-09 19:45:31

What are some of the best must see or do’s in the Bridgestone arena for someone who’s never seen a game there? Food? Drink? Etc. 

Do y’all sell the warm up pucks at all after the conclusion of warm ups? In Dallas you can purchase them during first intermission (I have warmup pucks from every opposing team here in Dallas that I’ve purchased over the years, so just curious if I can add to my collection or not) 

We plan on getting there when doors open to allow time to check out yalls digs, And catch warm ups from down on the glass. We do have seats in the 100’s on the stars end.

How can we get better? 

Realistically who do you think Preds should draft?  Forward? Defender? 

Would love Eiserman (sharks) or Celebrini (Calgary) 

What about Hage? Helenius? 

What about Silayev? Dickinson? 

What about free agents Nylander? Stamkos? Elias Patterson? 

Current Draft Picks
What about Joakim Kemell? 
What about Egor Afanasyev? 
What about Matt Wood? 
What about Tanner Molendyk? 
What about Spencer Stasney?

1091,103,17gi12x,Whatever happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators?-#23 Blair Atcheynum,"Blair Michael Atcheynum (born April 20, 1969, Estevan, Saskatchewan) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger. Atcheynum is of Cree descent.

Playing career

Atcheynum was selected in the third round, 52nd overall, by the Hartford Whalers in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft after scoring 70 goals in 71 games with the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League during the 1988–89 season. He never reached the NHL with the Whalers and was later claimed by the new Ottawa Senators in the 1992 NHL Expansion Draft.

He spent the majority of his career in the minor leagues but was able to break into the NHL for a total of 196 games over four seasons. He got his first taste of the NHL during the 1992–93 NHL season when he played four games for the Ottawa Senators, although he spent the majority of the season with their farm team, the New Haven Senators of the American Hockey League. It would take another four years to make it as a regular in the NHL. He played in 61 games (scoring a respectable 11 goals and 15 assists) during the 1997–98 NHL season for the St. Louis Blues after signing with the team as a free agent. The main reasoning behind Atcheynum being called up to the Blues during this period was due to the lack of depth on their roster early on in the 1997-98 season. With St. Louis, Atcheynum would typically play on a line with Craig Conroy and Scott Pellerin that was fondly referred to as the ""CPA Line"".

The next year he was selected in the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft by the newly formed Nashville Predators.He played 53 games with the Predators and had 8 goals and 6 assists before being traded back to St. Louis for a sixth-round draft pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. In 1999 he was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Blackhawks, with whom he played 66 games between 1999 and 2001. Atcheynum retired as a professional hockey player in 2001.

Atcheynum is currently an assistant coach with the Battlefords North Stars of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. He was also most recently honoured at the 2012 First Nation Games, alongside Fred Sasakamoose, who was the first treaty Indian to play in the NHL.",99titan,2023-10-25 23:08:52

1110,122,17cild9,Whatever Happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators? -#43 Vitali Yachmenev,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Yachmenev in action](https://preview.redd.it/7rennjecgevb1.jpg?width=211&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f77a0f5289269b93ad5b13f04c2ae18009d9620)

Vitali Yachmenev (born January 8, 1975, Chelyabinsk, USSR) is a Russian former professional ice hockey left wing. He was drafted in the third round, 59th overall, by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Drafted from the Ontario Hockey League's North Bay Centennials, Yachmenev made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut during 1995–96 season with the Kings, appearing in 80 games and scoring 19 goals. 

After two full seasons and part of a third with the Kings, where he scored a career high 53 points (19 goals, 34 assists) in his first season, Yachmenev was traded to the Nashville Predators before the team's inaugural season. Yachmenev played five full seasons with the Predators, and his best season as a Predator was the 2000-01 season, in which he scored 34 points (15 goals, 19 assists). In his NHL career, he appeared in 487 games, tallying 216 points, with 83 goals and 133 assists.

Yachmenev then moved to the Russian Hockey Super League, playing for Amur Khabarovsk during the 2003-04 season and Ak Bars Kazan from 2004–05.  He then moved to Avangard Omsk from 2005-2007.  Yachmenev then joined HC Dynamo Moscow and played for the KHL side from 2007-2010. In 2010-11, Vitali played with his hometown with Traktor Chelyabinsk.  In 2011-12 and 2012-13, Yachmenev played for Rubin Tyumen in the Supreme Hockey League, a second-tier league in Russia, where he retired in 2013. He finished with 393 games played in Russia between the Russian Super League, KHL, and Supreme Hockey League.  He tallied 153 points in Russia, with 56 goals and 97 assists.  

Yachmenev is currently on the staff of the North Bay U18 Trappers in North Bay, Ontario.

1127,139,17a3kws,"Nashville D-Men ""Individual Event Maps"" plus advanced stats","With the discussion around Fabbro potentially being traded, I started to look into the stats behind each player from the Boston game. Obviously this is only one game, and it was special teams heavy, but it's still fun to dive in. 

This Individual Event Maps don't tell the whole story but they do help tell some story, especially about each player's role on the team. Note that an event is a shot, block hit, or give away / take away and it's recorded by a human, so it's somewhat unreliable (for example, some people are more generous with hits, etc), and a one game sample isn't particularly useful. That said... 

https://imgur.com/a/jldboUO

McDonagh - stay at home D who blocks shots.  
Josi - no defensive zone ""events"" - in fact, ALL of his offensive zone events are on the power play.  
Barrie - True to his legacy - offensive contributor both on special teams and 5v5. Very little (but all positive) defensive zone contribution.   
Lauzon - shades of McDonagh. Blocked lots of shots, laid lots of hits. Barely a wrong step.  
Carrier - Overall good game but not a ton of offensive zone events.  
Fabbro - apparently just a punching bag? Man he took a lot of hits. Worth noting this includes a lot of PK time, so you're going to face more shots and be fighting for pucks more than even strength. But he did share PK time with Lauzon, who seemed to be far better at delivering hits. 

Interesting other pairing notes: 

Even: Fabbro was generally paired with Josi, Carrier with McDonagh, and Lauzon and Barrie. 
 
PK: the first pairing was McDonagh and Carrier (they played the whole game together), second Fabbro with Lauzon. 

Power Play: Almost overwhelmingly Josi and Barrie played on the first PP unit. Carrier was the sole D for the 2nd. This is opposite of last year's PP system where Josi QB'd the first unit, and then we'd bring on 2 Dmen on the 2nd unit, presumably for better coverage to transition to even strength. 

The lines shifted in the 3rd once we gave up the 3rd goal, with Barrie shifted up with Josi and Fabbro sent to the 3rd line with Lauzon.

1137,149,17802lv,"Elliotte Friedman: ""It would make a lot of sense for Vancouver to Trade Connor Garland to Nashville""","I am listening to the 32 Thoughts Podcast from October 13th.

Vancouver appears to be trying to trade Connor Garland. There are not a lot of teams with cap space. 

Friedman says that Vancouver is going to probably have to retain salary to get a deal done, and Nashville makes sense because they have a need for scorers, and they have the space. 

I assume that if something like this were to happen, we would probably be sending them a RD in return as it seems to be where we have the most depth and it would be an upgrade for Vancouver.

This does not make a lot of sense to me because of Garland's age and remaining contract. He is 27 and he is signed through 25-26 with a cap hit of $4,950,000/year. Friedman says Vancouver is probably going to have to retain at least 30% of his salary. His contract is not great for a guy who has only scored more than 20 goals once in his career. If they retained 50% of his salary, it makes a little more sense to me. It would also make his contract moveable when we have to give his roster spot to a younger player in the future.

If his cap hit were to get down to the $2,500,000 we are paying Fabbro, and we were to trade Fabbro for Garland, this would make a little sense to me. Garland would be an upgrade from Cole Smith or Kiefer Sherwood who are 27 and 28 respectively. I would like to think that Fabbro is worth more than this, but I am obviously biased. If there was a lot of demand for Fabbro, he would probably already be gone.

1166,178,172qpfd,Preseason and gurianov,"I spent part of this evening looking at preseason line combination TOI together to try and guess what starting lines could look like, and the following guys played significant time together:

Forsberg-ROR

Tomasino-Novak-Evangelista

Nyquist-Glass

Sissons-Trenin

Parssinen, Sherwood and to an extent Smith and Evangelista seemed to float around the lines a bit more.

Fagemo still in the air, but ROR and with Nyquist-Parssinen.

Gurianov played lots of minutes with the ROR and Glass combos, which has me really baffled what was going on to put him on waivers at this point. Any thoughts on what we were hoping with this guy? I’m guessing hopes of a new spark and some scoring infusion…. Maybe a lack of chemistry? Style?

At first it looked like an offsetting penalty that should've been 5 on 5? And then Carolina took 2 more penalties. So 5 v 3. (At this point I was pretty sure it should've been 4 v 2 but the refs didn't catch it). 

Then they called too many men on Nashville and made it 4v3 and let 2 guys out of the box during a commercial break. 

Did the announcers figure out what was happening? It seems like the refs got turned around. There was no explanation given on ice.",GMBarryTrotz,2023-10-06 19:03:20

1186,198,16x15lw,Whatever Happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators?- #25 Sergei Krivokrasov,"
Sergei Vladimirovich Krivokrasov (born April 15, 1974 in Angarsk, USSR) is a Russian former professional ice hockey forward who played in the National Hockey League for ten seasons between 1992 and 2002.

Krivokrasov came up through the ranks of the famed CSKA Moscow club in Russia, breaking into the full squad at age 17 in 1991–92 and scoring 10 goals. He was also one of the top players on the Russian squad which won the 1992 World Junior Championships. Due to this performance, the Chicago Blackhawks selected him in the first round, 12th overall, in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft.

Krivokrasov quickly signed with Chicago and was assigned to the Indianapolis Ice, the team's IHL affiliate for the 1992–93 season, where tallied 36 goals and 69 points as a rookie. This earned a four-game callup to Chicago. He remained in Indianapolis in 1993–94, and although his production dropped at that level, he appeared in another 9 games for Chicago, scoring his first NHL goal.

During the 1994–95 NHL lockout Krivokrasov was again in Indianapolis, but he was quickly promoted to Chicago at the conclusion of the lockout in January, and played regularly for Chicago for the rest of the campaign. His rookie season was an excellent one, as he posted 12 goals and 7 assists for 19 points in 41 games. His 12 goals placed him 6th on the Hawks and 8th amongst all NHL rookies.

However, after the success of his rookie year, the rest of Krivokrasov's stay in Chicago would be unsettled. He was briefly reassigned to Indianapolis in the midst of a disappointing sophomore campaign that saw him score only 6 goals in 46 games. He did, however, score the biggest goal of his NHL career, an overtime winner against the Colorado Avalanche in Game 4 of their second round playoff series. In 1996-97, he set career highs with 13 goals and 24 points, but his offensive production was still below what was expected given his promising start. After scoring only 10 goals in 1997–98, he was dealt to the expansion Nashville Predators in the summer of 1998.

On a first-year expansion team in Nashville, Krivokrasov was given more responsibility than he'd received in Chicago, and responded with the finest season of his career. He nearly doubled his career high with 25 goals to lead the Predators, finished 3rd on the club with 48 points, and was selected to be the franchise's representative at the 1999 NHL All-Star Game. His season was topped by the opportunity to represent Russia at the 1998 Winter Olympics, where he helped his country to a silver medal.

In 1999–2000, the inconsistency he showed in Chicago returned and he was replaced on the team's top line by Patric Kjellberg. Krivokrasov is credited with scoring the first NHL goal of the 21st century, in a 3-2 win against the San Jose Sharks on January 1, 2000. With just 9 goals and 26 points through 63 games, he was dealt at the NHL trade deadline to the Calgary Flames for Cale Hulse and a 3rd round draft pick. In Calgary, he responded well with 1 goal and 10 assists in 12 games to finish the year with 10 goals and 27 assists (a career high) for 37 points. However, Calgary decided to expose him in the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft where he was claimed by the Minnesota Wild.

Minnesota hoped that Krivokrasov could duplicate his performance two seasons prior for the first-year Predators, but he never settled into the defense-first system of head coach Jacques Lemaire. He finished the 2000–01 season with totals of just 7 goals and 22 points in 54 games, his lowest totals since 1996. 9 games into the 2001–02 campaign, he was dealt to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for a 7th round draft pick. In Anaheim, he fared no better, scoring just 1 goal in 17 games before being assigned to the minors for the first time in six years.

With his NHL career at a standstill, Krivokrasov returned to Russia for the 2002-03 season, signing for Amur Khabarovsk. He would have a fine season, finishing with 16 goals and 18 assists in 51 games. Towards the end of the 2003-04 season, he was moved to Avangard Omsk, one of the top teams in the Russian Hockey League, where he helped the team to the 2004 championship. This was not without controversy, however, as he was a central player in the Krivokrasov stick incident in the semifinals, in which he exchanged an illegal stick during a delay prior to measurement.

Krivokrasov's final few seasons in the Russian league would be nomadic as he appeared for 5 clubs between 2004 and 2008 (including Severstal Cherepovets, Dynamo Moscow and Metallurg Novokuznetsk), most notably a return to his first club CSKA Moscow in 2005–06. After two seasons with Metallurg Novokuznetsk, he retired in 2008. 
Krivokrasov now lives in Denver, CO and has two children, Vicka Krivokrasova, an Instagram model and Nikita Krivokrasov, who played in the WHL, SM Liga, and USHL

Krivokrasov finished his career with totals of 86 goals and 109 assists for 195 points in 450 NHL games.  In Russia, he added an additional 93 goals and 82 assists for 175 points in 375 games.

1215,227,16rtifu,"Whatever Happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators? -#22 Greg Johnson (A, C)","Greg Johnson was a professional ice hockey player in the National Hockey League with the Detroit Red Wings, Pittsburgh Penguins, Chicago Blackhawks, and Nashville Predators.

Born in Thunder Bay, Ontario in 1971, Johnson recorded 96 points in 47 games for the local Thunder Bay Flyers of the USHL in 1988–89. Johnson played four years at the University of North Dakota where he led the WCHA in assists twice and was placed on the conference First All-Star Team three straight years from 1991 to 1993. He was also placed on the NCAA West First All-American Team in 1991 and 1993.

Johnson was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers as the 33rd pick in the second round of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, but never played for the organization. On June 20, 1993, he was traded from the Flyers with future considerations to the Detroit Red Wings for Jim Cummins and a fourth round pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. Red Wings head coach and general manager Bryan Murray specifically targeted Johnson as a skilled center whom the Wings could develop.

Johnson spent parts of four seasons with the Red Wings from 1993 to 1997. On January 27, 1997, Johnson was traded by the Red Wings to the Pittsburgh Penguins for winger Tomas Sandstrom. Johnson played the rest of the 1996–97 season and part of the 1997–98 season with the Penguins before being traded to the Blackhawks for Tuomas Gronman on October 22, 1997.

Johnson was the 23rd pick of the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft by the Nashville Predators from the Chicago Blackhawks, and he would go on to spend the final seven years of his career with the team. Johnson was the second captain in Nashville Predators history from 2002 until 2006, and he served as an alternate captain from 1999 to 2002.

Johnson became part of an anomaly during the 2005–06 season when he was credited with scoring a goal before the start of a game against the Detroit Red Wings. On November 21, 2005, he scored a goal during the first period of a game that was eventually postponed after Red Wings defender Jiri Fischer suffered a cardiac arrest. The game was replayed on January 23, 2006, and, while the full game was replayed, Johnson's goal was allowed to stand, thus giving Nashville a 1–0 lead before the opening faceoff.

On August 14, 2006, Johnson signed a one-year contract to rejoin his former team, the Detroit Red Wings. In September 2006, during a routine preseason physical, an EKG test returned abnormal results. Johnson had further testing, and eventually decided to retire before training camp. In over 700 career NHL games, Johnson earned 350 points (134 goals and 216 assists). His best season was the 1998-99 season, in which he tallied 50 points (16 goals and 34 assists).  

Johnson earned a silver medal representing Canada at the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics. He also played for the Canadian National Team in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons.

Johnson's brother Ryan was also a professional hockey player, playing for five teams over a fifteen-year NHL career.  On July 7, 2019, Johnson passed away at his home in Detroit, aged 48

1230,242,16pedky,Whatever Happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators?-#71 Sébastien Bordeleau,"Sébastien Bordeleau (born February 15, 1975) was a Canadian-born French former professional ice hockey forward, whose lengthy career spanned from 1991 to 2012 in various leagues.

Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, while his father, Paulin Bordeleau, played for the Canucks, he spent several years growing up in France while his father played pro hockey there.  As a youth, he played in the 1987 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from France.  He also played in the 1989 tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Lanaudière.

After returning to Canada, he spent four years with the Hull Olympiques of the QMJHL. After being drafted by the Montreal Canadiens 73rd overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, Bordeleau was returned to his junior club to further develop his skills. His most productive year in Hull came in 1994–95 when he notched 52 goals.

During his first three pro seasons he played intermittently with Montreal, splitting his time with the AHL's Fredericton Canadiens. In the summer of 1998, Bordeleau was traded to the Nashville Predators. His best season in Nashville was 1998-99, in which he scored 16 goals and 40 points for the Predators.  He was also was a top penalty killer. Bordeleau continued in the same role the next season but saw less playing time in 2000–01. In the latter stages of the 2000–01 season, Bordeleau was claimed on waivers by the St. Louis Blues yet saw only limited action with the club's AHL affiliate in Worcester before being claimed in the 2001 Waiver Draft by the Minnesota Wild.

Upon his arrival with the Wild, Bordeleau went on to split his time between the parent club and their AHL affiliate in Houston before being dealt to the Phoenix Coyotes prior to the midway point of the season. Bordeleau went on to play six games with the Coyotes, while seeing most of his action with the club's AHL affiliate in Springfield, before opting to head overseas for the 2002–03 season.

After competing for seven years in North America, Bordeleau made his debut for SC Bern in the Swiss National League in 2002–03.  He played his final season in 2012 for EHC Biel in Switzerland.

Bordeleau represented France at the 2004 World Championships in Prague, Czech Republic, and at the 2008 World Championships in Quebec City.  

Bordeleau is the son of former NHL player Paulin Bordeleau and the father of current San Jose Sharks forward Thomas Bordeleau.  

On a funny note, Bordeleau was a big part of ""Check, Please, The Music of the Nashville Predators"", a CD made during  the first season that featured original Preds-themed songs and Pete Weber highlights from the season.  (Thank you u/SakuraRam1610 for posting the music on the sub and reminding me of the album). Bordeleau was the lead vocalist for the original songs on the album.

1231,243,16pc840,Question about the expected lineup,"Hey, Preds fans.  I'm making expected lineups for every team next season and had a question I hoped someone could answer.

I don't know what your expectations are for the lineup this year, but as a neutral fan, I look at the roster and see a bit of a logjam at center, as I feel that Novak, Glass, and Parssinen could all be in the top 9 forwards, but CapFriendly doesn't list any of them at wing, and if they all play down the middle, one would have to play on the 4th line.

1243,255,16mskeh,Help me design a frankenstein RR 3.0 jersey.,"Ok smashville. Doing a thing. I have a completely blank mustard cat practice jersey, and a friend who can make a crest and patches for it. I’m thinking a modified winter classy cat but with a nod to the terminator chrome crest from our blue jersey (silver,blue instead of gold,blue). Crest will use a metallic thread unlike the matte grey it is currently.

Also considering doing a small twill patch where the “Nashville” wording notoriously peels off but as “Smashville” in the same sizing as the OG instead of felt letters. 

What is the secondary logo going to be? 

Go all in and add future HOF Cole Smith kit on it?

1250,262,16in3lr,Whatever happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators?-#17 Patrick Côté,"Patrick Côté was a winger who played six seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL).  He later played the Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey in his native Quebec.

Côté was born in LaSalle, Quebec on January 24, 1975. As a youth, he played in the 1989 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Saint-Laurent, Quebec.

Selected 37th overall by the Dallas Stars in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, Côté played only six NHL games his first two years in the NHL.  Côté signed with the Nashville Predators as an enforcer for the 1998-99 season, where he scored three points (one goal and two assists) in 91 games over two seasons.  He also picked up 313 penalty minutes during his two seasons in Nashville, which still remains as a club record for PIM.   He played six games for the Edmonton Oilers in 2000-01 but spent the rest of that season with the Hamilton Bulldogs of the AHL. He played several seasons in the Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey between 2001 and 2008.

In 2002, he was arrested in Malone, New York, after police found 30 pounds of marijuana in his car. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge.  On July 22, 2014, he received a 30-month prison sentence following his robbery of two banks in suburban Montreal. In 2016, he was shot by a correctional officer at Donnacona Correctional Facility in Quebec for trying to kill another inmate with his bare hands after again being found guilty in another bank robbery in Brassard, Quebec.

1265,277,1679jvg,Whatever happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators?-#7-Cliff Ronning (A).,"Clifford John Ronning was born October 1, 1965, in Burnaby, British Columbia. Ronning played for the St. Louis Blues, Vancouver Canucks, Phoenix Coyotes, Nashville Predators, Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota Wild and New York Islanders in a career that spanned 18 years.

Ronning played minor hockey in Burnaby, where he led his midget team to a gold medal at the 1982 Air Canada Cup. Ronning was named most valuable player and led the tournament in scoring. Prior to being drafted, he played in the Western Hockey League for the New Westminster Bruins, displaying the same excellent scoring touch. In 1983–84, Ronning's draft year, he posted 136 points in 71 games, earning the Stewart ""Butch"" Paul Memorial Trophy as the league's rookie of the year.

Ronning was drafted 134th overall in the 1984 NHL Draft by the St. Louis Blues.  In 1984-85, he returned to New Westminster and accumulated an astonishing 197 points, establishing a WHL record (he was later surpassed by Rob Brown's 212-point season in 1986–87).  Accordingly, Ronning earned the WHL Most Valuable Player Award and the Bob Brownridge Memorial Trophy as the league's leading scorer. He was also named the league's most sportsmanlike player award after he only accumulated 20 penalty minutes for the season.

After Ronning's record setting season, he joined the Canadian National Team, where he played for one and a half seasons. During this stint, Ronning made his first appearance in the NHL with the Blues, playing five games in the 1986 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Ronning began the next season with the National Team again before joining the Blues for the remainder of 1986–87.

Ronning spent part of 1988–89 with the Blues' International Hockey League affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen, and played the entirety of the following season in Italy with HC Asiago. When he returned to the Blues in 1990–91, he was traded to his hometown team, the Vancouver Canucks, in a five-player deal.

Ronning quickly became a key element on the rapidly improving Canucks. In 1992–93, he posted a career-high 29 goals and 85 points. On April 15, 1993, in a game against the Los Angeles Kings, he nearly tied Brian Trottier's record for most points in a single period, notching 3 goals and 2 assists in the third. 

Ronning became a free agent after the 1995–96 season and signed with the Phoenix Coyotes for their first season post-Winnipeg. After two seasons in Phoenix, Ronning was dealt with Richard Lintner to the Nashville Predators for future considerations.

Ronning took on a leadership role with the fledgling Predators and served as an alternate captain during his time in Nashville.  During his four seasons with the Predators, Ronning led the team in scoring. He also played an important role in mentoring young players, such as David Legwand.  His best seasons were 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, where he scored 62 points each season.

At the 2001–02 trade deadline, the Predators sent Ronning to the Los Angeles Kings for their playoff push.  In the off-season, he was traded from Los Angeles to yet another recent expansion team, the Minnesota Wild. Ronning was a veteran presence, recording 48 points, as the Wild reached the Western Conference Finals before being swept by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.

In 2003–04, Ronning signed with the New York Islanders, mostly as a powerplay specialist, recording 24 points in 40 games played. As the NHL lockout suspended play, Ronning was inactive the following season. When the NHL resumed, Ronning announced his decision to retire on February 15, 2006. 

Ronning and his wife, Ivana, have four children: Taryn, Kristin and Carly and Ty. Ronning returned to live in Vancouver after his retirement. He plays with the Old-timers' Hockey Challenge and also coaches a spring hockey team, the Vancouver Selects.  In 2009, Cliff Ronning and Ron Kunisaki formed BASE Hockey Labs. Ronning heads up Base Hockey's Shooting Analysis and Custom Fitting protocol division in Burnaby, British Columbia.

Ronning's son, Ty, was drafted by the New York Rangers in the seventh round of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft.  As of 2023, Ty Ronning plays with Ingolstadt ERC in the German DEL.",99titan,2023-09-01 15:01:53

1272,284,1640aeg,Whatever happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators-#21-Tom Fitzgerald (C).,"Thomas James Fitzgerald played 17 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) and American Hockey League (AHL), and he was the first captain of the Nashville Predators.  

Fitzgerald was born in Billerica, Massachusetts and played his high school hockey at Austin Preparatory School in Reading, Massachusetts.  He then went on to play college hockey for Providence College and was selected by the New York Islanders of the NHL in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft (1st round, 17th overall). He turned pro in 1988 with the Islanders' American Hockey League affiliate, Springfield Indians, and in 1990 was one of the key players who led Indians to the Calder Cup championship.

He played parts of five seasons for the Islanders and became the first player in NHL playoff history to score two shorthanded goals on the same minor penalty, against the Pittsburgh Penguins on May 2, 1993, which also equaled the NHL record for shorthanded goals by a player in one game. He was selected as one of the original Florida Panthers in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft. Although he has been cast as a defensive forward in the NHL, he had his best scoring years in Miami and was one of the leaders in Florida's 1996 Stanley Cup run. In those 1995–96 playoffs, Fitzgerald scored the decisive goal in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was a 58-foot slapshot that found its way past Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso.

He was briefly traded to the Colorado Avalanche in 1998 before signing as a free agent in the subsequent offseason with the Nashville Predators, who sought out his veteran leadership. Fitzgerald was named Nashville's first captain, serving in the capacity from 1998-2002. His best season was his first, in which he scored 32 points (13G/19A). He subsequently played for the Chicago Blackhawks and the Toronto Maple Leafs. He had signed with the Maple Leafs to a two-year contract on July 18, 2002. While with Toronto, Fitzgerald and his Maple Leafs teammate Gary Roberts both played in the 1,000th game of their careers on January 13, 2004.

In the summer of 2004, Fitzgerald signed as a free agent with the Boston Bruins. In July 2006, the Boston Bruins chose not to renew his contract. He announced his retirement after 17 NHL seasons on September 12, 2006, and he did a brief stint with NESN after his retirement. 

In July 2007, Fitzgerald left NESN when he was named Director of Player Development for the Pittsburgh Penguins. In October 2007, he was then named as an assistant coach for the United States national team for the Deutschland Cup, where he led the team to a second-place finish.   On July 3, 2009, Fitzgerald was then promoted within the Penguins organization to assistant general manager. On July 24, 2015, Fitzgerald was named assistant general manager for the New Jersey Devils. On January 12, 2020, Fitzgerald was named interim general manager of the Devils after Ray Shero was fired. On July 9, 2020, Fitzgerald was named Executive Vice President and full time General Manager of the Devils, where he serves today.

Tom and his wife Kerry have four sons: Ryan, Casey, Jack and Brendan. His son Ryan was drafted in the fourth round (120th overall) in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft by the Boston Bruins, and currently plays for the Utica Comets, the New Jersey Devils' AHL affiliate. Casey, who was drafted in the third round (86th overall) of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres, currently plays for the Florida Panthers. Both Ryan and Casey attended Boston College, skating on the same roster from 2015–2017.

Fitzgerald grew up with his cousin, fellow NHL player Keith Tkachuk He is also cousins with Tkachuk's sons Matthew of the Florida Panthers and Brady of the Ottawa Senators, as well as Kevin Hayes of the St. Louis Blues and the late Jimmy Hayes, who most recently played for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.",99titan,2023-08-28 22:30:22

This is an annual thing for us in Raleigh, but he's never gone to an away game (and never flown before), so I'm treating him this year.

1280,292,15uvned,Predators /r/hockey Mock Offseason Recap,"Hey everyone,

Throughout the summer /u/sandman730, /u/meatb4ll, and /u/spyders95 organized an in-depth Reddit hockey offseason simulation.

We all followed the real-life important hockey events in the offseason and essentially had Reddit users take over as GMs, making (for the most part)
realistic changes to the lineup through the NHL entry draft, free agency, and trades.

The end goal of the sim was to create a 23-man roster that fans of the team would judge and see how the GM did in comparison to IRL.
If you have any questions about the moves made here, please ask your GMs in the comments.
Please remember that with 31 other simulated teams, prices could vary from real life especially when trades happened earlier in the sim than in real life

Please also check out the /r/hockey [recap post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/15utbdu/2023_rhockey_mock_offseason_recap/) for shoutouts to our UFA agents, RFA agents, and media team!

1284,296,15tqd92,First Time Buying Single-Game Tickets On 1st Day,"So this is the first season I've really been into planning games way ahead of time to go to. So when I saw single game tickets went on sale today I jumped on, but it seems there's barely any tickets available. I originally looked at the Blues game in april, but it looks like there's a lot of the same for the other games.

Are they going to release more, or are there really that many season ticket holders?

Edit: After being confused, I've noticed that lots of tickets are available for games up to Oct. 24. So now I'm more confused and annoyed. Like I know the April game is a long time away, but just release all the tickets at the same time. Now I'm probably going to forget about it since I don't want to have to keep checking all the time, and by the time I remember, it'll probably be all resale or last row. Screw TM

Edit #2: Looks like they did release them for that game, nearly an hour late. Oh also I assume this game has dynamic pricing since it's the only time the Blues come to town. 80+ for row M and back in the 300 corners",StupidPhysics58,2023-08-17 15:13:00

1295,307,15ni4fc,Whatever happened to the 1998-1999 Nashville Predators? - #1 Mike Dunham,"**(INFORMATIONAL) I have started a project looking back at the roster of the 1998-99 Nashville Predators.  I will be posting a short information post about each player that was on the roster for our first season.  My intent is to do this on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.  Any suggestions for improvement are always welcome.**

One of two opening night goaltenders for the 1998-1999 Nashville Predators was Mike Dunham.  Dunham was a native of Johnson City, NY, and attended Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, a Catholic boarding school, where he was an All-New England First Team under Coach Charlie Huntington. Dunham played college hockey for the University of Maine, where he shared the goaltending duties with Garth Snow. The team won the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship in Dunham's final season, 1992–93.

Dunham was drafted in the 3rd round (53rd overall) of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. He won the Calder Cup in 1995 with the Albany River Rats. He also won the William M. Jennings Trophy with Martin Brodeur after the 1996–97 NHL season. During the 1998 expansion draft, Mike Dunham was selected by the Nashville Predators, where he played four and a half seasons.  He split the starting role with Tomáš Vokoun during most of his career.

Dunham went on to play for the New York Rangers, Atlanta Thrashers, and New York Islanders after his time in Nashville. He participated in the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, helping the United States win the silver medal.  During the NHL lockout 2004-05, Dunham played with Skelleftea AIK in Sweden.  Dunham had a career record of 141–178–39–5, with 2.74 goals against average, 90.8% save percentage, and 19 shutouts.  His last season was 2006-07.

After his playing career, he went into coaching in 2007.  In September of 2007, Dunham was named goaltending coach of the New York Islanders. After 10 years, he left the Islanders in July 2017 to become the Boston Bruins' goalie development coach in August 2017, where he still serves.",99titan,2023-08-10 17:06:36

These seem like pretty reasonable line. I love the line debates. Thoughts?  


Novak/Parssinen seems forced, but I think the justifications on lines 2 make sense. If we needed a change of scenery, I wouldn't mind seeing Parssinen possibly on the RW with Tomasino-Glass. Hopefully this 3rd line combo can help Novaks horrible defensive play, but this could be a crucial depth line for scoring chances. This 3rd line could be where we see lots of Barrie/Josi points come in with Novaks big brain in the offensive zone.  


I like Sherwood on the herd line. I could see him/Cole Smith split time, especially on the PK, but Sherwood has the higher scoring potential and I think had a great run at the end of last year with Tomasino-Novak I believe (or was it Novak-Evangelista?) and deserves a chance. He also posted up with Tage Thompson which was awesome that he got that a scoring threat off the ice. I am a Sherwood fan. ",KaleidoscopeOk1346,2023-07-26 14:59:39

1315,327,159sosu,How to Get Around Restricted Ticket Sales,"A few years ago my family moved from Nashville to Seattle.  Every year when we come home for Thanksgiving we try to go to a Predators game.  We really want to go to the Blackhawks game this year, but all the tickets are suspiciously sold out on Ticketmaster.  I suspect we’re being blocked because of our location.  Reason #1: the games before and after have plenty of tickets available.  Reason #2: Other sites like Stubhub have tickets available.  Last year we were able to get through the sales process only to have our credit card declined due to having out of state billing address.  We got around that by changing our address to my mama’s house in Mount Pleasant :).  I tried going through a VPN, but now Ticketmaster just thinks I’m a bot and won’t even let me on the site (I’m not mad about that actually).  All this to ask if anyone else has encountered this problem and figured out a work around.  I don’t want to buy the tickets on Stubhub because of the fees.  I suppose I will if I have to.

1326,338,1536f09,Coming down end of October. Hoping to catch the Preds-Leafs game,"hey preds fans. 

i'm looking to come down from Calgary for a friend's 40th the last weekend of October and (fingers crossed) get tickets to the Leafs-Preds game and maybe the Titans. Assuming there's no issue buying tickets, is there a known section for good atmosphere or is it like the Dome and it's awfully quiet except for that guy behind me who knows what everyone should be doing at all times? i'm looking forward to checking out the city but mostly looking forward to hearing the you suck and it's all your fault chants live (if you still do it)

I'm hoping to stay in the SoBro area around the Korean Vets Blvd, which looks to be recommended from the visiting nashville sub and there's plenty of options to stay. (72 degrees in Oct?? you lucky bastards!)

My question is two fold, I know that Broadway has a ton of bars but is there a bar that Preds fans go to before the game? I went to an Avs game a few years ago and their fans had one right near the arena. We have one a block away from the dome as well as inside the dome that people go to. Is tailgating a thing there for hockey? And maybe most importantly, I'm hoping to score a Smashville jersey. Any chance that they still sell them at the arena or should i start looking before I leave around here? If I am unable to source one here, is there a known store in the downtown area that might? 

Anything other info for a visitor would be fantastic and thanks in advance.",joustswindmills,2023-07-18 18:34:36

According to Daily Faceoff these are the projected lines for the start of the season. Obviously, things can change over the next 3 months, but for a ""rebuilding"" team this is the perfect mixture of veteran presence and young talent. This is going to be an unbelievably fun season and with the pool of prospects getting even deeper thanks to Poile's parting gifts and some quick moves by Trotz we now have another 4 players who possibly could be stepping onto the ice within 2-3 years in Wood, Molendyk, Nilsson, and Lind.

1367,379,14oe51k,The Nashville Predators' Intriguing Free Agency Moves: Rebuilding or Retooling?,"In an unexpected turn of events on the first day of free agency, the Nashville Predators made some surprising acquisitions, inking deals with three veteran players: Ryan O'Reilly, Luke Schenn, and Gustav Nyquist. The signings came hot on the heels of a roster shake-up earlier in the week, which saw the Predators bid farewell to star forward Matt Duchene *(who has now signed with Dallas)* and sent longtime centerman Ryan Johansen packing to the Colorado Avalanche. The combination of these moves over the last few days has confused some fans about the team's direction and long-term strategy. In this short overview, I want to take a look at these moves from a few angles and try and figure out the rationale behind these decisions.

Earlier in the week, speculation ran rampant after the buyout of Duchene's contract and the departure of Ryan Johansen, with fans curious about what the freed-up cap space and empty roster spots could mean regarding the team's future. Were they clearing cap space for a blockbuster acquisition? Or perhaps a big trade move was in the works?

Just hours after free agency began, the sudden signings of three players, all aged 32 or above, caught many off guard. Only a few short days ago, General Manager Barry Trotz stated that the team wouldn't be active in the free agency market. Their focus seemed to be centered on opening up the roster for young players to receive a more significant role to make their mark on the squad. So, the acquisition of O'Reilly, Schenn, and Nyquist rightly left some fans surprised and perplexed.

The trio of new players for the Predators starkly contrasts the culture and work ethic left behind by Duchene and Johansen. They embody the qualities of seasoned veterans and natural leaders, precisely the kind of role models needed to guide and inspire the young players on the roster. Their influence could prove to be invaluable for nurturing the talents of the up-and-coming players.

Yet, opinions on the signings are divided. Some feel that bringing in these veterans will take valuable playing time away from the young players who stepped up so much last season. While others feel signing these experienced players is crucial to the development of the teams' younger talents. They believe that a healthy mix of seasoned professionals and promising prospects is the recipe for success in the long run.

Sometimes a rebuild isn't necessarily about hitting rock bottom; instead, it's about resetting or reviving the team's culture, which can be effectively achieved with the right veterans in place.

It's evident that Trotz has a clear vision for his version of the Predators, which revolves around instilling a winning locker room culture with proven winners.

For those puzzled by the signings, there's a compelling rationale behind it. The front office is looking to infuse the team with veterans who epitomize hard work and professionalism. The departures of Duchene and Johansen paved the way for this new veteran group, aimed at setting an example for the young players on how to conduct themselves on and off the ice.

While some fans might wonder if the money spent on the trio could have been allocated differently, I believe it's essential to trust in Trotz's plan and give him the benefit of the doubt until we see how his plan works out. The Predators already boast an impressive pool of prospects, and investing in experienced players is a calculated risk that could propel the team forward and foster a thriving culture for the young players to walk into.

Ultimately, whether these signings lead to a rebuilding phase or a retooling strategy remains to be fully seen. What's clear is that the Predators are charting their own path, and it's a journey that fans should be eager to witness. The new blend of veteran wisdom and youthful energy could be the key to unlocking this team's true potential.",Apprehensive_Ad4572,2023-07-02 03:44:54

**Scouting Report:**

There are smooth skaters, there are explosive skaters, and there’s Tanner Molendyk. Every game is a masterclass in some element of skating, whether that’s turns, cutbacks, speed, or lateral movement. That mobility could make him the surprise challenger for the draft’s top defenceman down the line.

A quick series of crossovers launch Molendyk past multiple opponents; it doesn’t matter if he’s moving forwards, backwards, or laterally. At full speed, he changes directions with sudden outside edge cuts, heel-to-heel skating, and tight turns.

With that skating, Molendyk stays in opponents’ faces non-stop. Even speedier, skilled opponents struggle as he instantly claims the middle, forces them wide, then darts across for the steal in a blink of an eye. His stick work’s precise, and his hits heavy. Undoubtedly, he’s one of the best rush defenders to come through the last few drafts.

Then, Molendyk goes on the attack. Part-dynamic rusher, part-passer, he carves up the forecheck before sending a team up the ice with a long-range pass. He makes every play in motion to instantly join the rush. There’s little doubt that he will continue to outskate opponents in the NHL, and he could do so much more.

“*He can beat defenders off the point in so many different ways: fake shots on pass receptions, faking inside to the outside, stop-start deception, head fakes, and so on,*” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American scouting Mitch Brown wrote in January. “*But he never commits to it. As soon as the defender closes a bit of space, he hits the brakes and throws the puck into the corner. He doesn’t read the opponents’ feet, it seems, which leads to turnovers (sometimes) and missed opportunities to create (often).*”

As the margin for error shrinks with each step up the ladder, being able to squeeze the most out of every inch of space counts more and more.

Of course, Molendyk doesn’t have to become a dynamic play-creator to reach the NHL. That’s the benefit of being a dynamic play-killer with breakout skill. But if he can learn to exploit the opportunities his skating creates, there’s a real chance he’s a complete, minute-munching defenceman inside a team’s top-four.

**Industry Chatter:**

“*Elite skater. Probably the fastest player in the draft. Guys can’t touch him when he has the puck between the blue lines. I think he’s a pretty good defensive player too. Hands and brain need to catch up to his feet though.*” – Eastern Conference scout, May 2023

**24. Nashville Predators:** **Tanner Molendyk**, LHD, SASKATOON (WHL)

February 3, 2005 | 5′ 11″ | 181 pounds

Tier: Middle of the lineup player

**Player comparable:** Mario Ferraro

**Background:** Molendyk has played a ton of minutes for a strong Saskatoon team this season. He hasn’t put up big point totals but often isn’t on PP1 for them. He led Canada in ice time in their Hlinka semifinal win over Finland and was second in ice time in the gold medal win over Sweden. Molendyk grew significantly in a short period of time. He measured in during the summer at 5-foot-10 and 3/4 inches and is close to six feet now. He was the fifth pick in his WHL Bantam Draft.

**Analysis:** Molendyk is a strong two-way defenseman despite not being the biggest defender. This is because of his excellent skating ability and strong work ethic. Molendyk’s edgework is very good. He closes on checks like a pro and is able to evade pressure at a high level. His top speed is good, not great, but he can lead a rush in the NHL. Molendyk has strong offensive instincts and skills and can make plays from off the blue line and on the move. His size will be a minor issue as a defenseman in the NHL, but he plays hard and doesn’t shy from physical play often landing hard hits at the junior level. I think he checks a lot of boxes and projects to be a top-four defenseman.

**Thoughts on the pick:** Tanner Molendyk is a favorite of mine. He’s an outstanding skater who plays hard and I think moves the puck well enough too. He’s not the biggest guy, but he reminds me of guys like Alexander Romanov and Mario Ferraro, and I think he could be a second-pair defenseman. After being a defense factory for so long, Nashville hasn’t invested much draft capital of late high on defenders, so this is a much-needed boost to their system.",Unknown,2023-06-30 21:36:32

**Scouting Report:**

Matthew Wood was the youngest player in college hockey, and still one of its most effective ones in spite of that, finishing his freshman year with 34 points in 35 contests at the University of Connecticut. This, after a 45-goal, 85-point draft-minus-one in the BCHL with the Victoria Grizzlies.

He’s a player that’s long been on scouts’ radar, and with good reason. Wood’s been putting up video game numbers at nearly every level he’s played, done so in a projectable 6-foot-3 frame, and drawn rave reviews for his character off of the ice.

Still, we greeted Wood with considerable skepticism coming into the year. That he struggled so immensely at the U18s last spring and then at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup to start this scouting season offered pause that perhaps much of his gaudy scoring could be attributed to playing in the not-so-competitive Coastal Conference in a Junior A league (albeit one of the stronger ones).

Much of this skepticism appeared to be confirmed by Wood’s early work at college. Sure, the points came easy. The Huskies funneled their power play through his cannon of a shot, and it worked. Closer scrutiny revealed a mostly unidimensional player with significant mechanical hurdles and inflated point totals.

“*Wood has mostly played like a blunt object at college, but it hasn’t kept him from stringing together some highly productive outings with UConn in the early goings,”* EP Rinkside Editor-in-Chief and resident college hockey scout J.D. Burke wrote in one of his October game reports. *“Many of the same red flags that tempered my enthusiasm at the Hlinka Gretzky remain. Wood is still playing an incredibly simple north-south game and not showing much explosiveness or dynamism in the process.*”

Then, something changed. Wood’s game took a significant step forward in time for the new year, showing a more projectable, compelling complement of skills that just might allow him to generate offence at the next level in a sustainable fashion.

You start with the handling. Where Wood used to exclusively take on defenders from a glide with the puck exposed well in front of him and his feet and hands locked in unison, he was now using hip pocket handling, feints, weight shifts, and even give-and-goes to get around defenders. You know, the sort of thing that will work against NHL defencemen.

Next up, growth as a distributor. Simple things like scanning away from the puck and maintaining a detailed mental map of the ice allowed him to connect with pacey one- and two-touch passing plays. You’re not looking at the second coming of Joe Thornton here, but Wood became a strong enough distributor that teams now have to respect the threat of his pass. This, of course, will open up opportunities as a shooter.

Still, the skating is grim. That much hasn’t changed. It was every bit as sluggish at the U18s to close out the year as it was at Hlinka Gretzky that started it. And it affects every part of his game. Any hope of a top-six projection rests on at least a full-grade improvement in this regard over the next two or three seasons.

When you watch someone take as many significant steps forward in their development over the course of their draft year as Wood did at UConn this season, though, it’s easy enough to imagine a scenario where that happens. He’d hardly be the first player in a 6-foot-3 frame to need a little extra time to get up to speed.

If that happens, Wood has the capacity to be a top-six forward with size, a booming shot that can credibly threaten from range, handling skill, and some cunning as a distributor. No, he’s probably not the next Tage Thompson, no matter how many outlets will try to make that comparison, but he can be a solid contributor in his own right.

**Industry Chatter:**

“*Biggish centre that I think can grow a bit. Get the feet moving. I like that he went to UConn, I like seeing more Canadians going that route, using American colleges like Fantilli and Wood did to get roles at 18 they maybe wouldn’t otherwise. I also like how strong he is.*” - Western Conference scout, May 2023

“*He’s a little bit of an enigma there. On the power play, he’s great. When his top speed is going, he’s fine. It’s just that his skating is a big concern for where the NHL is going right now. He’s got a great stick, soft hands, but you never see him as the F1 and you only really see him score on the power play. His first three steps really have to improve. He does some good things, it’s just that there are some holes in his game.*” – Western Conference scout, May 2023

“*I’ve been to games where Wood has outplayed Cutter Gauthier. The production is tremendous for his age. Elite shooter. One of the best shots in the draft. Awesome offensive hockey sense. Gets open in scoring areas. Ability to make plays with his stick. Some question his compete. I have no issue with it. The skating is his major detriment. If he makes the NHL he will be one of the worst skaters. At the same time at the Hlinka, last year internationally, BCHL. He’s produced beyond his age level. Release, size. Hands, hockey sense is top end. Could be a Mark Stone type.*” – NHL scout, April 2023

“*I’d say I’m an offensive threat. I can score from anywhere and make plays. But I don’t take the defensive side of the game lightly at all.*” – Matthew Wood, April 2023

“*I wear 71 because of Yevgeni Malkin. He has always been my favourite player. Obviously, Tage Thompson went to UConn as well. I try to look at his game and model my game after him too. Two great players and I really look up to those guys for sure.*” – Matthew Wood, April 2023

“*With Matthew Wood, he’s a big, tall guy with some speed, great hands, and he complemented the other guys, but he can make some plays as well that kind of make you go ‘wow.’*” – Canada U18 head coach Jeff Truitt, April 2023

“*I thought college would help me work on things like playing with pace stuff like that. It’s a fast game with strong guys and I thought that would get me ready for the next level and push me to where I want to be.*” – Matthew Wood, December 2022

“*I love making plays. Finding open guys. Drawing guys to me. It’s one of my favorite parts of the game.*” – Matthew Wood, December 2022

**15. Nashville** **Predators**: **Matthew Wood**, RW, UCONN (H-EAST)

February 6, 2005 | 6′ 4″ | 197 pounds

Tier: Bubble top and middle of the lineup player

**Player comparable:** Drake Batherson

**Background:** Wood had a highly productive 17-year-old freshman season at UConn scoring a point per game. As a 16-year-old he led the BCHL in goals and points. At both this past summer’s Hlinka Gretzky and the 2022 U18 worlds, Wood played a limited even-strength/heavy power-play role for Team Canada but at the 2023 U18 worlds he was a top forward at the tournament.

**Analysis:** Wood is a very gifted offensive player. He has excellent one-on-one skills and offensive IQ. He has the ability to hold onto pucks for an extra second and knows how to beat defenders with skill. He also has an excellent wrist shot and one-timer, making him a major asset on the power play. Wood is a big winger as well, so the size/skill combo has a lot of upside. However, his skating is an issue as he lacks the ability to separate, and the pace of the NHL will challenge him. I wouldn’t call him an overly physical or high compete type, and I’ve seen him take nights off, but Wood is a big body who can use his frame to win battles and gets to the inside parts of the offensive zone well enough. I think he’ll be a quality top six winger who will be a big part of an NHL power play, but he may frustrate his coaches at times.

**Thoughts on the pick:** Wood is a very talented offensive player. It’s not easy to find first-year draft eligibles who led their NCAA team in scoring, never mind at 6-foot-4. The Predators have a lot of needs for their rebuild, but they need high-end talent most of all, and Wood provides that. He needs to round out his game and with his OK footspeed he may need two to four years before he’s ready for the NHL.",Unknown,2023-06-30 21:15:28

1390,402,14n7ff3,Breaking Down the Nashville Predators' Decision to Buy Out Matt Duchene: A Bold Move with a Hidden Agenda?,"In a surprising move, the Nashville Predators have decided to buy out the remaining contract of star forward Matt Duchene.  

Duchene, who has been a pivotal contributor to the Predators' in recent seasons, certainly doesn't deserve to be written off as a failure. Throughout his time in Nashville he has been a solid contributor and has had some fantastic years with the club, including last season, when he was the team's leading scoring forward and a critical piece to their success when he was healthy. 

After the news of the buyout broke, speculation immediately began to swirl, with fans and pundits alike wondering whether this move was merely a precursor to a more significant acquisition via free agency or trade. Could the Predators be eyeing a high-profile forward to bolster their lineup? This move might make more sense if it was to free up some cap space if a substantial addition was on the horizon. Barry Trotz has already proven to be an aggressive general manager, and it wouldn't be surprising to see him make a splash here in the next few days.

However, buying out Duchene's contract raises questions about the team's long-term plans. With significant dead cap space resulting from this move, it's worth wondering if the Predators are set on a complete rebuild of the team. If trading superstar goaltender Juuse Saros is on the table, that might signal a shift toward a complete tank. But if general manager Barry Trotz's recent statements are to be believed, he insists that Saros **is not** being actively shopped. This leaves fans in a perplexing position. What was this buyout's purpose if a Saros trade isnt on the horizon?

Another point of contention is the impact of this move on the team's competitiveness. Despite the buyout, the Predators are not yet positioning themselves as a full-blown tanking team. With a world-class goaltender like Saros, who is a Vezina Trophy contender every season he plays, they are still expected to compete and remain in the playoff picture. The notion of tanking with Saros between the pipes seems implausible, as he has single-handedly prevented the Predators from missing the playoffs multiple times in his career. If the vision is indeed to tank, then a Saros trade would make sense and align with that strategy. However, if Saros remains with the team, this buyout raises more questions than answers.

The Predators find themselves at a crossroads. This move is undeniably perplexing, considering Duchene's contributions and the long-lasting impact of the dead cap space. There are only two viable paths forward for the organization. Either they fully embrace a rebuild, trading Saros and committing to the tank, or they aggressively pursue trades and offer sheets for restricted free agents and take risks to reshape their roster into a competitive force once again. 

While some may argue that this buyout was a misstep, others hope the Predators have a master plan in motion. Fans and pundits anxiously await further developments and announcements from the Nashville front office.

When it comes to evaluating the Nashville Predators' draft picks, one cannot easily pinpoint any players who could be deemed as outright ""steals"" based on their draft positions. While Matthew Wood, selected 15th overall, could be considered a reasonable choice given his average consensus ranking of 13, it doesn't necessarily scream out as an impressive or noteworthy selection in terms of value. Personally, I had him slotted in at the 20th spot on my big board, which makes it somewhat of a slight reach in my estimation.

Now, let's delve into the rankings for the Predators' second pick, Tanner Molendyk, taken at the 24th spot overall. It's worth mentioning that my big board had him ranked 64th, while the consensus ranking had him pegged as the 40th-best prospect. Once again, this selection leans more towards the reach category rather than an exceptional value pick.

Examining the first two choices made by the Predators, it becomes evident that they had their sights set on these players but failed to acquire great value in the process. However, two names do stand out when discussing value acquisitions. First up is Jesse Kiiskinen, the 68th overall pick, who remarkably secured the 18th spot on my big board. The average consensus rank positioned him as the 67th-best prospect in the entire draft.  Another player who surprisingly slipped down the draft order was Aiden Fink, nabbed by the Predators at the 218th spot in the seventh round. From my evaluation, Fink ranked as the 48th best prospect, while the average consensus placed him at 100th. This late-round steal truly caught my attention, as I anticipated his name being called much earlier.

All in all, the Predators executed a solid draft strategy, focusing on players that catered to their specific needs rather than simply selecting the best available prospect. While they may not have secured any groundbreaking steals, the aforementioned Kiiskinen and Fink certainly represent valuable additions to the organization.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Preds Prospect Overviews:**

&#x200B;

**Matthew Wood:** Wood is a standout 18-year-old forward from the NCAA's Huskies and has emerged as one of the most promising prospects in college hockey. His improved wrist shot, characterized by a well-maintained distance between his feet and hands, has become a potent weapon, allowing him to shoot accurately from various positions and even in motion. Wood's ability to seamlessly chain together plays, whether it's making decisive passes under pressure or executing toe-drags to create shooting opportunities, showcases his exceptional offensive instincts. Standing at an imposing 6-foot-4 and weighing 197 pounds, Wood's lethal shot, averaging approximately three per game, has caught the attention of many scouts, who laud him as a big power forward with an amazing ability to find the back of the net. With continued development, Wood's raw talent and scoring prowess could propel him to great heights at the NHL level.

&#x200B;

**Tanner Molendyk:** A skillful and smooth-skating blueliner, he stands out with his exceptional agility, mobility, and speed. His ability to elude opponents in all areas of the ice and create scoring chances is a testament to his confidence and patience in decision-making. Despite his smaller stature, Molendyk plays bigger than his size, delivering impactful open-ice hits. His offensive instincts are often overlooked, as his point total doesn't fully reflect his threat to generate offensive chances. Defensively, he excels and is relied upon as a valuable contributor on the penalty kill. In the 2023 Draft class, Molendyk's standout feature is his unmatched skating ability, characterized by his explosive speed, flawless transitions, and precise stick work. With his accurate shot and strong transition game, he proves himself to be a capable two-way defender.

&#x200B;

**Felix Nilsson:** Nilsson is a well-rounded center with a high hockey IQ and excellent playmaking abilities. His strong vision and mental awareness enable him to create scoring opportunities for his teammates through precise passing and quick decision-making. While not necessarily elite in any specific aspect, Nilsson's above-average skills in all areas of the game make him a reliable player who excels both offensively and defensively. With his continued development, Nilsson has the potential to become a valuable third-line center in the NHL, capable of contributing to both even-strength play and power play.

&#x200B;

**Kalan Lind:** A fearless and physical player whose skills are tied together by his unending intensity. With a knack for making big hits and winning body positioning, Lind also demonstrates subtle brilliance in his game. He excels at tying up opponents around his own net, setting picks, and creating seamless breakouts. Additionally, his simple yet effective style stands out as he uses his speed to drive straight to the net, forcing the opposition to back up and creating space for himself. Lind's ability to find loose pucks and finish scoring opportunities, particularly when crashing the crease, showcases his sixth sense on the ice. His aggressive play, relentless forechecking, and ability to get under opponents' skin make him a challenging player to face. Lind's all-around game is evident as he competes in all areas of the ice, consistently emptying the tank between whistles. With continued development, he is poised to become a bottom-six forward who excels on the penalty kill while also providing decent offensive production. As Lind gains more weight, his physicality will become an even greater asset in the NHL.

&#x200B;

**Jesse Kiiskinen:** Kiiskinen is an exceptionally driven player who never quits on a play. His relentless work ethic shines through in his tenacious forechecking, catching defenders off-guard, and making key defensive contributions. Kiiskinen's offensive skills are particularly impressive, as he possesses a powerful shot and the ability to both score goals and make precise passes. With further development, his skating and strength will only improve, making him an even greater threat on the ice. Kiiskinen's leadership qualities are evident in his ""lead by example"" style of play, and while his potential is initially projected as a third-line winger, his young age and room for growth suggest the possibility of reaching second-line status with proper development.

&#x200B;

**Dylan MacKinnon:** MacKinnon is a reliable and adaptable defenseman who excels in his defensive responsibilities. His solid skating stance and active stick allow him to effectively defend against opposing rushes, while his strong presence in the neutral zone ensures he maintains excellent gap control. MacKinnon's physicality and net-front coverage skills make him a difficult player to go up against, and as his offensive abilities continue to develop, he has the potential to become a valuable second-pairing shutdown defenseman in the NHL. Whether protecting a lead or making a game-changing defensive play, MacKinnon is a player who consistently rises to the occasion.

&#x200B;

**Aiden Fink:** The standout player in Canada's Junior A circuit this season, possesses an impressive arsenal of skills that make him a formidable force on the ice. With his exceptional speed, energy, and anticipation, Fink sets the tempo of play and consistently executes the best offensive plays. His NHL-caliber shot, combined with his creative playmaking ability, forces defenders to make difficult choices. Fink's ability to maneuver with the puck at high speeds, as well as his contributions to the success of the Brooks Bandits, demonstrate his potential to excel at higher levels. While he may be smaller in stature, Fink's exceptional puck skills, craftiness, and timing in the offensive zone indicate that he has the potential to become a middle-six winger in the NHL. With further development and increased physicality, Fink's speed and shot alone make him a strong candidate for an NHL bottom-six role.

1426,438,14kfti1,Predators 2023 NHL Draft - Potential Realistic Targets and Analysis,"With the 2023 draft less than 48 hours away, it is time to look towards some of the players that the Preds may select with the #15 & #24 picks (Assuming the picks are kept).

As many of you may know through your involvement in this sub, following prospects in hockey is a personal interest of mine. I am by no means an expert, but I have spent significant time watching many of the top players in this class, and wanted to share some of my outlooks with you all!

&#x200B;

Pick #15

***Oliver Moore (C) - USNTDP (USHL)***

**Personal Rank #8**

**Consensus Rank #10-20**

Analysis - Moore is arguably the top skater in the class, with fluid skating mechanics that rival the best I have ever covered for a prospect. Playing on his own line on the USNTDP team, Moore still dominated without the help of Smith, Leonard or Perrault. His speed stands out, but his hands are able to match his quick movement, with IQ that utilizes both to the highest potential. A true dual-threat to pass and shoot, Moore has the raw skill that I believe will be able to translate at the NHL level.

**Projection - First Line All-Star Caliber Winger**

&#x200B;

***Dmitri Simashev (D) - Lokomotiv (KHL)***

**Personal Rank #9**

**Consensus Rank #10-30**

Analysis - My personal favourite and the one who I believe is the most underrated in the class, Simashev oozes upside that gets me extremely excited. At 6'4"", you may think he lacks mobility, but that's actually his strongest trait! The kid can flat-out skate, exiting the zone all by himself, even in the second best league in the world. His offensive upside is elite, but his defensive game makes for a safe floor as an overall player. Due to his high-end skating, Simashev is able to shutdown opposing players on rushes with both his stick and his body, often laying punishing hits. If everything breaks right, I see him turning into a Hedman-esque player.

**Projection - #2 All-Star D-man with #1 Upside**

&#x200B;

***Axel-Sandin Pellika (D) - Skelleftea (SHL)***

**Personal Rank #12**

**Consensus Rank #10-20**

Analysis - Poise, poise, poise. That's the easiest way to describe him. I have never covered a defenseman as calm as Pellika. Another fantastic skater, Pellika is able to maneuver his way around under pressure, as if he's not under pressure at all. It's difficult to find prospects without a glaring weakness, but Pellika breaks that theory. Safe overall floor, with upside to be one of the highest point producers from the back-end in the future. Don't want to get you all too excited, but I truly see shades of Josi in his skating.

**Projection - #2 D-man**

&#x200B;

Pick #24

***Mikhail Gulyayev (D) - Omsk Avangard (KHL)***

**Personal Rank #13**

**Consensus Rank #15-30**

Analysis - Another one of my favourite prospects in this class, Gulyayev is an absolute speedster that often acts as a one-man defensive zone exit. He's truly mesmerizing to watch, as he eases his way past everyone on the ice consistently. His defensive ability is not a liability due to his elite skating, but his size may give him issues in corners with the top NHL puck-protectors. I believe the skating is worth taking a shot on the upside alone. He's an ideal PP QB with his elite-level zone entries.

**Projection - #2-3 D-man**

&#x200B;

***Andrew Cristall (LW) - Kelowna (WHL)***

**Personal Rank #9**

**Consensus Rank #10-30**

Analysis - Contrary to what I typically look for in a prospect (Skating), Cristall is actually very underwhelming in this department, which is a reason why I think he could slip to this pick on draft day. Although his skating mechanics need major work, his other attributes such as his ridiculous hands and vision more than make up for it and give him a monstrous ceiling if he can become even an average NHL skater. He's an offensive dynamo, with creativity that rivals the top in this class.

**Projection - Second Liner with First Liner upside if skating improves**

&#x200B;

1435,447,14ibho8,Thoughts and breakdown after the Trade,"Obviously, this trade sheds light once again on the Predators’ intent to revamp this roster. As the dust settles on this trade, I want to delve into the intricacies and potential ramifications for the Predators.

Ryan Johansen, known for his mercurial performances and playmaking abilities, had been a cornerstone of the Predators’ forward line for nearly a decade. However, his inconsistency and recent injury proneness rendered him a questionable investment against his hefty $8 million per year contract. By trading Johansen away, the Predators have freed up cap space and relieved themselves of a player who failed to live up to the expectations set by his substantial salary.  
When you look at the acquisition (if they even choose to sign him) of Alex Galchenyuk in this trade, the Predators received a former third-overall pick who has experienced both success and setbacks during his NHL career. While Galchenyuk spent the previous season in the AHL, his past achievements as a consistent near 20-goal scorer stand out. Although his role on the Predators’ roster remains uncertain, his potential utility makes him an intriguing addition if kept on. The Predators may have seen something in Galchenyuk that could contribute to their plans, or they might let him walk in free agency. 

  
With Johansen’s departure from the team, the Predators are poised to embrace the emergence of young talent throughout the entire roster. The likely candidate to fill the Center role is the promising Cody Glass, who showcased his improvement and skills during the previous season. Glass, at the age of 24, presents a perfect bridge piece for the team’s ongoing rebuild, with the potential to provide stability and contribute to the Predators’ offensive prowess for the foreseeable future.  
This trade may signify the Predators’ desire to make a substantial splash in the trade market this offseason. General Manager Barry Trotz has already voiced his disinterest in this season’s free agency options, hinting at the team’s intention to utilize the newly available resources. With the freed-up cap space and an arsenal of draft picks acquired through last season’s trades, the Predators are now in an ideal position to pursue top-tier available players. Alex DeBrincat, a name linked to the Predators in recent weeks, could fit the bill, bringing much-needed offensive talent and scoring ability to the team.  
Regardless of the team’s motivations behind this trade, Ryan Johansen’s departure will undoubtedly leave a void in Nashville. The fans and his teammates will miss his contributions on and off the ice. However, this trade represents a calculated move by the Predators to shed cap space, rejuvenate their roster, and position themselves for future success. As the NHL offseason unfolds, the Predators possess the financial flexibility and assets to make significant moves in the trade market, ensuring an intriguing and transformative period for the franchise.

&#x200B;

**Just curious what others think about this. Do you think this means the Preds are going after a big name in the trade market, and if so, who should they go after? Im going to miss Joey, but I'm hoping that 4 million goes to signing or trading for someone who can be dynamic on offense.**

All we had to do was appear on the Jumbotron for the “Nissan Thrill of the Game Seat Upgrade” for 10 seconds. The wife and I agreed with no hesitation. Sat next to some season ticket holders who were truly the nicest people I’ve ever met. The game went into overtime and seven round shootout. Cody Glass with the winning goal. Preds win! Best first game experience ever. I can’t thank Bridgestone and the Predators enough for helping us make one more  great memory on our honeymoon. Truly an experience I will never forget.

[https://www.espn.co.uk/nhl/recap/\_/gameId/310123006](https://www.espn.co.uk/nhl/recap/_/gameId/310123006)

I was searching on youtube and [nhl.com](https://nhl.com) but I can't find the Game in 6 or video recap of this game anywhere.  


So I like making posts about Cody Franson because I always loved watching him play, and I always thought he was a legitimately good defenseman who is severely underappreciated. I think he is a player who deserves another shot in the NHL to see what he is capable of on a good team, especially because he is the kind of guy who absolutely kills it come playoff time. In that game that I posted, Franson gets two assists + a shootout goal, and I think it's his only attempt in the NHL (he scored in his AHL attempt too). So finding the game video to this is very valuable to me.

Thank you Nashville bros!

1462,474,14a3qpg,We're no longer Private or Restricted as a subreddit.,"[During our initial announcement of participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Predators/comments/143nx54/rpredators_will_be_going_dark_from_june_1214_in/), we received overwhelming positive feedback, with the primary response to the 48hr protest suggesting that we make the protest indefinite.

Throughout the blackout where most communities went dark, I was personally disappointed with the lack of action by Reddit to correct their course. I was an active Digg user right up until they dug their own grave through less-egregious moves than we're seeing Reddit make today (in my opinion.)

After the 48 hours, the biggest criticism of the protest was that ""no protest with an end date will ever change anything."" Some of the mods who were initially against anything beyond 48hrs seemed to agree with this sentiment, leading to our move to Restricted.

When we went Restricted, we heard some of you criticize the decision to do this without preparing any announcement beforehand, or allowing anyone to voice their opposition before the Restricted setting was active. This still allowed people to comment in the post about it, and some of you did comment. As near as I can tell, a similar number of you commented your vocal disapproval for any post-48hr participation as did initially support the indefinite blackout.

We mods of course would have loved to have a poll to refer to and assure that we're making the right choice by the majority, but at this point, the most-committed users to the blackout would have never seen the poll, and the vocal critics would be over-represented in the results - a pretty interesting dynamic, if you think about it.

To those of you who say that no protest should have taken place, as nothing would have changed - I respond that this is view is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Take no action, and you can be sure you get no reaction.

To those who perhaps wished that we stayed private in solidarity to help affect change - I suggest you find the biggest community that you frequent which is still private, and message the mods that you support their protest. If our little subreddit for a sports team in the off-season had users spinning off their own new subreddits to fill the apparent void, just imagine what mods of the larger subs are dealing with.

Regardless of everything, we're back so feel free to post all of the Preds news you've been wanting to share.",vorin,2023-06-15 14:23:13
1463,475,149by7s,"r/Predators is back, but we'll be in ""Restricted"" mode for a while","(most of this has been shamelessly stolen from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1495wpj/askhistorians_is_back_up_but_currently_restricted/))

We’re back! Well, almost. As many are aware, as part of the site-wide protests we closed the sub for the past few days. While we have taken the subreddit off of ‘Private’, it is now going ‘Restricted’. This means that no new submissions can be made except by mods, and comments are limited. We know people still have questions, so we’ll be addressing some of them here:

**How long will AskHistorians be Restricted?**

We don’t have a specific end-date, and reopening is intertwined with several factors which we are continually weighing. These include: what response, if any, we see from reddit; internal discussions by the mod team about how we, as individuals, are feeling about things; and evaluation of the changes that are happening, how they will impact our modding, and how we can adapt to deal with them in a way which allows us to continue to moderate the sub.

**Why are you Restricted? Why not just stay private?**

While we went entirely private for two days as part of the reddit-wide blackout, many participants are in favor of a longer period of protest, and so are we. But we want to find a balance to ensure it is as effective as possible, and we believe that reopening in ‘Restricted’ mode does so. It still puts pressure on the Admins by signaling our position, but also allows us to reach a much bigger audience by having this and our previous statements more easily accessible, amplifying the message to more users.

In addition, it opens up our archives for users to read past posts, but limits other discussions which also emphasizes what is being lost when we are unable to run the sub.

**What Happens Next?**

We don’t know what the final results will look like, nor can we make any promises beyond the fact that we will continue to act and be guided in our decisions by what we believe is best for the community. We will continue our internal discussions and evaluations, and provide periodic updates to the community as we deem appropriate. We dearly hope circumstances will allow us to reopen fully very soon.

While the above covers the core issue of the Blackout and Locking of the sub, we’ve had a few questions which keep getting asked either in previous Meta threads, or in modmail the past few days, so we’re also addressing them here:

**I completely missed what is happening? Can you fill me in on the background?**

Last month, reddit announced changes to their API which impacts certain third-party apps which provide critical mod tools, especially on mobile. You can find our previous statements [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Predators/comments/143nx54/rpredators_will_be_going_dark_from_june_1214_in/). We would also recommend [the recent coverage in the New York Times for a broader look](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/business/media/reddit-subreddit-blackout-protest.html).

**Can I get access to the subreddit? Pretty please?**

While we have moved the subreddit off of Private, it remains Restricted. In practical terms, only Approved Users can post in a Restricted subreddit, and Approved Users are pretty much limited to Mods. We understand that many of you have news you want to post, and recognize how frustrating it can be when the mods take longer to post news or something, but we are not planning to make exceptions. We hope that we will be able to unlock soon and things will return to normal.

**Will you be going somewhere else?**

Not at this point. Maybe in the future. There are some interesting alternatives to reddit cropping up in the Fediverse (like [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/)), but they are small at this point. Obviously, there are boards, groups, channels, etc on other platforms where you can find communities of Predators fans.",pwnicholson,2023-06-14 16:15:27

1501,513,13xhj3m,"While we're fixing things, can we do something about the TV crew?","Last night I was desperate for hockey, so I watched the Rochester vs. Hersey game on AHL TV. I was blown away by how good the Rochester broadcast team sounded...and they're in the AHL. It got me thinking about how the Preds TV broadcasts are subpar. I mean, there's nothing wrong with them...but they're just eh. Coincidentally, The Athletic posted an article this week ranking the NHL broadcast teams that pretty much says the same thing. 

So what would you do to fix it? I'd start by moving Willy to the desk. I like him, but he's not a natural PBP guy. I mean he got the radio PBP job because someone else quit mid-season, remember that? Then he moved to TV when Pete wanted to do radio. Nothing against him, but I think he'd be better hosting at the desk. 

I think Max Herz would be a good replacement on PBP. He's young, but so what? The Kings hired a 20-something for their TV PBP and it worked out fine. He sounds good and he's got passion in his voice. 

I also like when Mase and Skillsy are together. Maybe put Mase between the benches (many teams do this full time) and have Hal in the booth.

Trotz and Brunette talked about more speed and scoring and playing more modern hockey. They openly said they wanted to make it more exciting and fun for fans.

Also, there is no doubt Trotz is running the show and he is going to do exactly what he thinks is best for the team. Some people around the league might have been pissed about not firing Hynes earlier. It doesn’t look like he is too concerned with outside opinions. It was pretty obvious Trotz is going to put the organization over any individual.

I think the process was a home run for Trotz. From LeBrun’s article, it sounds like he interviewed six coaches. He took all his time and didn’t waiver from it. It doesn’t look like he is going to half-ass his job and he is going to be very aggressive.

Brunette is of course something of an unknown but for sure he seems like Trotz’s guy. This is something of a change in that Poile hired his coach and then supported him. It looks like now, the coach is here as part of Trotz’s vision for the team.",evanwilliams212,2023-05-31 19:02:23

1523,535,13v0wis,Should we trade up for Matvei Michkov?,"Matvei Michkov is an ELITE RW in the coming draft. Many scouts are saying that Michkov is the closest prospect to Bedard this year in terms of pure talent. Kind of like how Eichel was second to McDavid, even though they are both Centers. Any other year Eichel probably would have been the first overall pick. Some draft experts are saying that about Michkov, even though Michkov is a RW and not a Center. 

For those of you who don't know, he has signed a contract to play in the KHL through the 24-25 season. Everyone thinks that he will come to the NHL at that time, but there is a possiblity that he could stay in the KHL after that. Some players have chosen to stay in the KHL instead of playing in the NHL in the past, but none of the prospects at this high a level have ever chosen to stay in the KHL. The war in Ukraine adds a little uncertainty as well, but it is unlikely that he would be affected by it. Additionally, many GMs don't have the job stability to wait 2+ years for a Top 10 prospect.

All of the NHL draft pundits seem mixed on where he might get drafted. Detroit and Arizona both make sense as landing spots for him. Detroit, because Detroit's GM is Steve Yzerman (who is russian), or Arizona because they need desprately need something to excite their fan base.  St. Louis and Washington could also make sense, to replace Terasenko and Ovechkin respectively.

If Michkov falls to 15, he would be a steal. Poile loves to draft players who fall to him (i.e. Kemell, Tomasino, Tolvanen), and you have to think that Trotz will want a player like this after coaching Ovechkin. But it is very unlikely that he falls out of the top 10.

Finally, with the draft being in Nashville, this would be the one move that would compete with the attention of Chicago getting Bedard.

How would you feel about Nashville trading up to get Michkov?",MusicCityJayhawk,2023-05-29 17:21:46

In the realm of the NHL, few names carry as much weight and respect as Patrick Roy. With a storied playing career and a wealth of coaching accolades, Roy embodies the essence of a true leader behind the bench. Fondly referred to as ""Saint Patrick,"" his remarkable achievements and unique coaching style make him an ideal fit for the Nashville Predators.  
Roy's playing days were split between two renowned franchises: the Montreal Canadiens and the Colorado Avalanche. Over his illustrious 19-year career, he captured the hearts of fans and the attention of the hockey world. The iconic goaltender secured an impressive four Stanley Cups, with two triumphs for each team he represented.  
Acknowledged as the greatest goaltender in NHL history, Roy's legacy extends beyond his remarkable on-ice performances. The influential netminder was deservedly inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 13, 2006, forever solidifying his place among the sport's elite.  
However, it is Roy's coaching prowess that truly sets him apart. In the 2013–14 season, he steered the Colorado Avalanche to a staggering 112-point season, capturing the Central Division title. The team's remarkable accomplishments included tying a franchise record with 52 wins, boasting the league's best road record, and an impressive undefeated streak when leading after two periods. Roy was bestowed with the Jack Adams Award for his invaluable contributions, recognized as the NHL's top coach. This accolade marked his ability to inspire greatness in his players and lead them to unprecedented success.  
Beyond his NHL achievements, Roy's coaching prowess extends to his tenure in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). For an impressive 13 years, from 2005 to 2013 and then again from 2018 to 2023, he commanded the helm of the Quebec Remparts.  
Roy's teams made the playoffs every season he coached, highlighting his consistency and ability to develop winning cultures. Additionally, he steered his squad to first-place finishes in the division for an impressive six out of the 13 seasons—an undeniable testament to his coaching acumen and ability to foster a winning environment.  
One of Roy's greatest assets is his reputation as a players' coach. Known for his unwavering support and defense of his players, he strikes a delicate balance between advocating for his team while also holding them accountable. Although occasionally drawing attention, his outspokenness and aggression showcase his commitment to honesty and integrity, traits that have earned him respect throughout the league.  
As Nathan MacKinnon, one of Roy's former players, revealed, ""I didn't realize how smart he'd be. He understands the game so well… It's only my second season, but I'm sure he's one of the most progressive coaches in the league."" MacKinnon's words illuminate Roy's ability to think strategically and adapt to the evolving nature of the sport. This progressive mindset, coupled with his genuine passion and competitive drive, make him an ideal mentor for the Nashville Predators' young squad.  
In a league where communication and connection with players are paramount, Roy's relatability shines through. He possesses the unique ability to make his players feel appreciated, heard, and valued, fostering a positive and supportive environment. This aspect becomes even more crucial when working with a young team like the Predators, where guidance and mentorship are vital for player development.  
Patrick Roy's illustrious playing career, combined with his remarkable coaching accomplishments, make him an ideal fit for the Nashville Predators. His unique coaching style, ability to inspire greatness, and dedication to player development set him apart as a top-tier coach in the NHL. With his expertise, experience, and winning mindset he brings, Roy would undoubtedly lead the Predators to new levels of success and establish a culture of excellence within the organization.

&#x200B;

* Stanley Cup Appearances: 2 (0-2)

&#x200B;

* Made Playoffs in 63% of years coached

&#x200B;

* Coached 100-point teams 42% of the time

&#x200B;

* Jack Adams Award Winner (2006-7)

Thanks to his illustrious track record, Alain Vigneault is a prime contender for the head coach position at the Nashville Predators. Over the years, he has managed to have success with several teams, including the Montreal Canadiens, Vancouver Canucks, New York Rangers, and Philadelphia Flyers. In 2007, he clinched the prestigious Jack Adams Award, which recognizes the NHL's top coach of the year. During his time in Vancouver, he became the Canucks all-time winningest coach with 313 wins, winning back-to-back Presidents' Trophies and appearing in one Stanley Cup Final.

His innovative approach to the game sets Vigneault apart from other coaches. He employs modern tactics that allow his star players to shine, experimenting with his roster to maximize their potential. Vigneault is adept at reading the opposition, strategically deploying his players to exploit their weak points and gain a competitive edge. His resource management skills are unparalleled, making him one of the finest coaches in the world.

&#x200B;

**Claude Julien** *(62 years old)*

&#x200B;

* Points Percentage: 58.7%

&#x200B;

* Playoff Win-Loss Percentage: 54.4%

&#x200B;

* Stanley Cup Appearances: 2 (**1**\-1)

&#x200B;

* Made Playoffs in 52.6% of years coached

&#x200B;

* Coached 100-point teams 26.3% of the time

&#x200B;

* Jack Adams Award Winner (2008-9)

Claude Julien's impressive coaching career speaks volumes, highlighted by his stellar points percentage of 58.7% and a Stanley Cup championship win with the Boston Bruins in 2011. Throughout his illustrious career, he has led his teams to the playoffs an impressive ten times, enjoying deep runs in several appearances. One of Julien's notable strengths is his ability to create a solid defensive foundation through sound structures and effective systems. He strongly emphasizes defense, but not at the expense of offense, as evidenced by his Bruins team being one of the better possession teams in the NHL after the 2012 lockout. With a talented forward corps and an elite goaltender anchoring the defense, Julien's strategic approach could be an ideal fit for the Nashville Predators. With his guidance, the Predators' young core could develop into a formidable team capable of challenging for the Stanley Cup in the coming years.

&#x200B;

**Dan Bylsma** *(52 years old)*

&#x200B;

* Points Percentage: 61.5%

&#x200B;

* Coached 100-point teams 50% of the time

&#x200B;

* Jack Adams Award Winner (2010-11)

Dan Bylsma could be the right coach to lead the Nashville Predators to glory. His impressive track record speaks volumes; with a points percentage of 61.5% and a playoff win-loss percentage of 55.1%, Bylsma has the experience and winning mentality the Predators need. He led the Penguins to the Stanley Cup championship in 2009 and reached the playoffs in 75% of the years he coached while boasting a 50% success rate with 100-point teams. Bylsma's coaching philosophy is rooted in a north-south style of play, with an emphasis on quick, long stretch passes that keep opponents off balance. His system can be complex, but it has proven to be effective, as evidenced by his Jack Adams Award for the league's most outstanding coach in 2010-2011. Bylsma's offbeat approach to motivating his players, such as rewarding the last player to score in a shootout practice with the responsibility of growing a mustache, could be what the Predators need to lighten the mood in the locker room. All things considered, Dan Bylsma's winning record and innovative coaching style make him a prime candidate for the Nashville Predators' head coaching position.

&#x200B;

**Bruce Boudreau** *(68 years old)*

&#x200B;

* Jack Adams Award Winner (2007-8)

Former Vancouver Canucks head coach Bruce Boudreau presents a promising candidate for the Nashville Predators' head coaching position. With an impressive coaching record that includes a Jack Adams Award win and experience with four different NHL teams, Boudreau has demonstrated his ability to lead teams to success in the regular season. Notably, he ranks second in NHL history for coaches with at least 900 games coached in terms of winning percentage. He has turned around struggling teams midseason, such as when he took over the Washington Capitals in 2007 and led them to their first playoff appearance in five years.

Boudreau's coaching style centers around a fast-paced, ""run and gun"" approach to offense that has yielded success for players such as Alexander Ovechkin and Nicklas Bäckström during his time with the Capitals. Additionally, Boudreau has a track record of developing players and helping them achieve career years, such as Ryan Getzlaf, Nick Bonino, and Mikael Granlund. His brief time with the Vancouver Canucks also demonstrated his ability to make an impact with a team in a short period.

Overall, Boudreau's extensive experience, impressive coaching accolades, and player development skills make him a strong contender for the Nashville Predators' head coaching position.

Moreover, Hartley is recognized for his strict discipline, willing to sit even his most talented players if tardiness or lack of effort becomes an issue. His commitment to success is also evidenced by his unyielding work ethic and exceptional motivational skills. By joining the Nashville Predators', Hartley could be the key that unlocks their potential and elevates the team to greater heights.

&#x200B;

**Young Coaches:**

If the Nashville Predators are looking for a fresh and promising option for their head coach, grooming a talented assistant coach could be a great avenue to explore. A young and ambitious coach who has been affiliated with successful NHL teams and has firsthand experience with winning cultures, strategies, and teams could be the perfect candidate for the job.

With the recent appointment of General Manager Barry Trotz, he could potentially take the reins and mentor this budding coach throughout the entirety of the rebuild process. This approach would allow for a smooth transition and continuity in the team's development.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that all the coaches listed possess substantial NHL experience, including time spent as players. This experience could prove valuable as they strive to lead the Nashville Predators toward a bright and successful future.

Moreover, as a member of the Boston Bruins, Kelly played a pivotal role in helping his team clinch the Stanley Cup in 2011, a career highlight that endowed him with a wealth of experience on a championship-winning team.

Following his retirement from playing in 2018, Kelly successfully transitioned to coaching, initially joining the Ottawa Senators as a development coach before earning a well-deserved promotion to the Boston Bruins in 2021. As a member of one of the NHL's most successful teams, Kelly had the unique opportunity to observe first-hand the inner workings of a high-performing locker room and the strategies that drive such success. Indeed, Kelly's commitment to excellence and winning mindset as a player and a coach make him a potentially valuable addition to the Nashville Predators' coaching staff, offering the team a unique perspective and a wealth of experience.

Tim Gleason, a former first-round pick from Ottawa and current assistant coach for the Carolina Hurricanes, represents a compelling prospect for a head coaching position. Known for his tough and gritty style of play during his playing days, Gleason was appointed assistant coach to the Carolina Hurricanes on September 2nd, 2021, and has made an immediate impact.

As a coaching staff member for one of the NHL's most high-scoring and electrifying teams, Gleason has had the opportunity to observe and contribute to the team's significant success over the past few seasons.

His accolades include winning the OHL Scholastic Player of the Year award in '98, and the Memorial Cup's Most Sportsmanlike Player award the same year. Notably, Malhotra played alongside the legendary Wayne Gretzky, making him the last active player to do so.

As a two-way forward, Malhotra was a faceoff specialist, winning over 56% of faceoffs taken during his NHL career. Since retiring, Malhotra has transitioned to coaching, joining the Vancouver Canucks as an assistant coach in 2017 and later moving to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2020. He has been privy to the inner workings of successful NHL teams, observing their strategies and tactics firsthand.

With years of coaching experience behind him and an intimate understanding of what it takes to succeed in the NHL, Malhotra should be a top contender for a head coaching position.

* NHL Games Played: 735

&#x200B;

His hard-nosed playstyle made him a fan favorite, as he accumulated over 1500 career hits and wasn't afraid to mix it up with opponents.

After his playing days, Ruutu transitioned to coaching and was recently hired as an assistant coach with the Florida Panthers in June 2021. As one of the top teams in the NHL, the Panthers have been a great learning environment for Ruutu, who has been able to contribute to their success. Additionally, his experience in player development as Assistant Director of Player Development with the New York Rangers adds another valuable area of expertise to his coaching abilities.

Although he may be less experienced than other candidates, Ruutu's unique background and skillset make him a fascinating option for a head coaching position.

**COMMUNITY** - Once your player is drafted onto a team you will gain access to a private locker room for your organization, and their Discord server. Here is often where the closest relationships develop, and where you’ll make some great new friends to share your SHL journey with. You can spend time discussing the season, reflecting on your success, or just having a blast hanging out together!

1559,571,13jrfns,Ads games are so much fun,"First of all, a big thank you to every one who kindly replied to my last post and provided tips on parking and food! All are very helpful, definitely made my trip easy.

I was at both Game 1 and Game 2 last weekend. First time sitting behind the penalty box, had a blast! There was a 3-on-5 in Game 1, and Texas's Barber was in the box THREE times in Game 2.

Both games were exciting, you guys saw them. Beyond the games, I really enjoyed everything, the fans were loud, concession was decent, lots of food and drink choices, the fan games/videos during the intermission/breaks were very entertaining. THEY ALSO HAD A BLIMP! Got two free bells at the entrance, one for each game, and bought a T-shirt, a magnet and a Roscoe pin. (It would have been the icing on the cake if I won either or both the 50/50 raffles XD.)

Just started to watch hockey games this year, lucky to have both of these teams to root for! Go Ads and Go Preds!

1564,576,13iggyj,Short Snapshots: Will Joakim Kemell have a spot on the Nashville Predators Roster next Season?," Joakim Kemell, the young 19-year-old Finnish winger, has been making waves in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Milwaukee Admirals this season. With a keen eye for space and a deadly shot, Kemell has been one of the AHL's most exciting young players to end the regular season, ranking ninth in the league in win-share percentage for players 21 years old or younger (as of April 23rd, 2023). But with the NHL offseason looming, some Preds fans are asking: will Kemell make the jump to the Predators roster this coming season, or will he continue his development in the AHL? Let's dive into this question a bit. There is no denying that Kemell's skill set is impressive. He has a knack for finding open space and positioning himself for scoring opportunities, and his shooting ability is top-notch. He's not afraid to get creative with the puck and take on defenders, making him an entertaining player to watch. Despite being 5'11"", Kemell plays with a lot of jump, physicality, and more grit than most people give him credit for. Even though he's been having impressive AHL performances, there are still concerns about Kemell's readiness for the NHL. The Nashville Predators have a history of being patient with young prospects in the organization, giving them time to develop in the AHL for long periods of time. Kemell is still adjusting to North American ice after playing in Finland his entire career, and depending on how he performs in the Calder playoffs this year and the regular season next year, he may need another season in the AHL before jumping to the NHL to fully adjust and refine his skills on an American rink.

 The Predators will have a lot of players vying for a spot on the wing next season. Veterans like Mark Jankowski, Michael McCarron, Cole Smith, and Keifer Sherwood will all be fighting for a spot, and that’s not even including young players such as Egor Afanasyev, Luke Evangelista, and Phil Tomasino. All these players will be in the mix for the last few wing spots on the roster, and a few very talented players arent going to make the cut. Given Nashville’s tendency to let young players develop in the AHL, it’s unlikely that Kemell will get the nod over these more experienced players. That being said, Kemell’s performance in the AHL this season has been encouraging, and he has proved that he could adapt to North American ice and excel in a smaller rink. His ability to score goals and make plays will undoubtedly catch the attention of Nashville’s coaching staff in training camp and preseason. While it’s unlikely he’ll make the roster next season, the future looks bright for this young Finnish star.

Schaefer scored the first goal in a comeback attempt 28 seconds into the third period last night, but Seattle [eventually lost](https://whl.ca/article/ice-hang-on-to-win-game-1-of-2023-whl-championship-series-presented-by-nutrien) and fell to 0-1 in the series.

We have 2 first rounders and 13 picks this draft it might be worth moving up to get some real elite level talent. My list personally is 
1. David Reinbacher
2.Axel Sandin Pelikka 
3.Dalibor Dvorsky
4.Braden Yager
5.Tom Willander
There are plenty of others that I would be happy to get but these are the guys I’m most excited for based on our team needs. Would love to know what you guys think we should do in the draft?",mk1700,2023-05-11 18:04:24

No other arena is so focused, so passionate. I swear when I go to Preds games it feels like the whole arena is calling out in a single voice to the opposing team’s goalie, answering back the PA announcer, and just cheering on the greatest team in hockey. Even for meaningless, out of conference games in the middle of the season, the Bridgestone crowd is just unreal.

1606,618,1357j1t,Fyodor Svechkov,"Something should happen with the Preds’ first-round pick from a couple of years ago in the next few days. KHL contracts have expired and some players are starting to sign with NHL teams. Svechkov could sign with Nashville or he could re-up in Russia.

Svechkov was drafted as a good two-way Center. Initially, he was property of KHL powerhouse SKA St. Petersburg but was part of a crazy 9-for-1 trade with Spartak last year. Most of those nine players were players who either weren’t expected to stick around or played somewhere else. Getting traded could lead one to believe he wanted to come to the NHL sooner than later.

SKA also had Askarov before and barely played him in any league when he wouldn’t extend that last year.

This season, Svechkov split time in the three Russian leagues again. He played the most as a fourth-liner with Spartak and scored a few goals as a 19-year old. He was also very good in the MHL (Russian juniors) and VHL (the Russian version of the AHL) playoffs. It appears he found another level to his game. His offense keeps getting better.

It would not be the worst thing for him to play a couple more years in the KHL but I expect him to come over for next year.",evanwilliams212,2023-05-02 01:29:59

1618,630,12z4n1b,Saros > playoff goal keepers,"Watching this post season, it’s pretty clear how spoiled we all are with Saros. Skinner in particular is trash. He’s putting so many shots out into dangerous rebound territory, while we are so used to seeing Saros catch, block down and smother, or block to the boards on similar shots. Even Hallebuyck and Vassy aren’t having great series. Can you imagine if Saros was in there for the Oilers or Lightning? 

Folks, we are spoiled. I just hope we put together a team in time for Saros to hoist the cup. It still hurts me that we never got Rinne there.",wvWvvvWvw,2023-04-26 03:10:44

1643,655,12n7ge6,End of the Poile era,"Last night was a much better time than I thought it would be, and I say this as a guy who’s married to an Av’s fan. Not our best season, arguably not even a very good one, but damn I had fun regardless, and the future’s bright y’all. 

My only gripe about last night (feel free to throw cold water on me if this is a dumb take): I wish the ovation for Poile had been more enthusiastic. It was tepid and that made for an awkward moment in the arena. 

Yes, I understand how bad we’ve been boned lately with bad trades, big contracts that don’t yield results, and the entire coaching situation. I’m not thrilled about any of that. But! 

Poile was the architect of some incredible lineups over the years, and we were so damn close. The refs/Joey’s injury in ‘17. Those final seconds of Game 5 vs Chicago in ‘10. Even the Sharks series in ‘07 when they were somehow allowed to push us around with no whistles. (We don’t talk about 2012 vs Arizona.) 

Most importantly, he was instrumental in *keeping the team in Nashville* during the nightmare fire-sale days. 

Maybe I’m seeing the world through a rose-colored visor, but I appreciate you, David. Perhaps this is all due to ticket prices (the balance of hard core fans vs. tourists and wealthy-but-unenthusiastic people in the stands has changed), but I thought you deserved better.",Clovis_Winslow,2023-04-15 15:27:26

1645,657,12mon32,I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things.,"Gosh, y’all. What a season this has been. It’s a historic one but not the way we thought it’d be. For all the criticism I have had along with all y’all, I’m sad to say farewell to so many aspects of this chunk of Nashville. We’ve let go of beloved players as well as the man who got us those players. Once the reality of the road ahead set in, It was good to see the kids get their chance. It wasn’t the veterans or the execs that brought back the identity of this team, it was the kids. 

Not hoisting the cup isn’t necessarily a sign that a team or their season is a failure. Everyone wants to win but as much as I hate the cliché, it’s not so black and white. The big win doesn’t happen without the cumulative successes of everyone. Embrace the mistakes because it builds experience and teaches lessons to carry forward from the guys on the ice to every one of us. To be the man you gotta beat the man and that doesn’t always happen because you were born with a gold spoon in your mouth that propelled you to be the intercontinental heavyweight world champion. Sometimes, it takes sticking to your guns and figuring it out.

We have a team that’s always worth fighting for(edit: we already did once when those douchebags tried to move the team). That team is part of a city that’s worth fighting for. It’s altogether part of the identity that makes us the best goddamned thing to happen to this planet since one of our dipshit single cell grandparents decided aerobic respiration was the way to go.

There’s always the chance that things might get worse, but I don’t give a shit. I’m too busy losing my mind with the best fans in the world while we watch the best team in the world. I wouldn’t want it any other way and from the bottom of my stone cold cast iron heart, thank all y’all for being there every step of the way.",KillerGoats,2023-04-15 03:38:48

1692,704,12fxw55,How do you kids watch the games these?,"Days? 

Long time Preds fan and STH (2014-2021), long time lurker and first time post. 
I looked in the wiki and couldn't find it, so my apologies if this breaks etiquette. However, I think the boys have caught the attention of a lot of old fans that have moved away or watching less the last few years who want to watch the boys clinch a playoff spot and make a run. 

I live in Lawrenceburg and have Bally's Sports and been seeing Rodeo and all kinds of other shit on instead of the Preds. Was happy to see that they've been streaming on ESPN+ since my brother has an account but it says the games are Blacked Out in our area WTF?! 

So would someone be so kind to explain how I can watch legally free, legally paid, or otherwise 🏴‍☠️ so I can watch the game tonight in TENNESSEE? TYIA

PS: I'm sure this has been said a lot lately but with the Sinclair bullshit it's time teams/cities own their own damn networks and include it in STH benefits so we can watch all the games without Jerry rigging a low latency stream with a 10 minute lag. That alone would've kept me and a lot of my buddies as STH and kept us engaged in the team instead of being blackballed from the fanbase due to RSNs. It would also engage fans who aren't STH and grow the fanbase with new fans. With Nashville now having a MLS team and wanting a baseball team, it would be great if a group like Ryman Entertainment, Haslams, and a few of the rich Nashville normies would start a digital omnichannel and broadcast the games for free OTA for Nashville cordcutters (Ryman/Circle ch 4.2) and on Comcast/Charter through carriage distribution like they do MLS. Hell, I'd even watch a late night replay of the games if I could right now. Sean Henry and Colin Reid give me a call and we can discuss lol.",methodtan,2023-04-08 20:45:40

Despite everyone’s negativity about how we are out of playoffs already, I like to remain positive and hopeful. I’d like to see the kids play playoffs this season. I don’t want to wait a whole year. It would also be a great experience for them to build off for next season.

And maybe we will get to see Saros in the playoffs steal games for us. It will kind of be like a reverse playoffs from last year when we had a relatively healthy team, but no goaltending since Saros was hurt. 

I’m also convinced Forsberg and Josi are healthy. Can’t change my mind.

1716,728,12bafm6,My Top Coaching Candidates To Replace John Hynes as the Nashville Predators Coach:," I have compiled a list of my top coaching candidates to potentially replace John Hines at the conclusion of the current season. This list features a mix of seasoned veterans who are seeking a fresh start in their coaching careers, as well as promising young coaches who are eager to make their mark and establish themselves within the field.

&#x200B;

**Veterans:**

**Alain Vigneault** *(61 years old)*

* Points Percentage: 58.5%
* Playoff Win-Loss Percentage: 50.3%
* Stanley Cup Appearances: 2 (0-2)
* Made Playoffs in 63% of years coached
* Coached 100-point teams 42% of the time
* Jack Adams Award Winner (2006-7)

Vigneault is a strong candidate for head coach of the Nashville Predators based on his past achievements. He has coached several teams, including the Montreal Canadiens, Vancouver Canucks, New York Rangers, and the Philadelphia Flyers, and won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL’s top coach of the year in 2007. He is the Canucks’ all-time winningest coach, with 313 wins, and under his leadership, the Canucks won back-to-back Presidents’ Trophies and made one Stanley Cup Finals appearance. Vigneault is a modern strategic thinker who experiments with his roster, putting into practice modern ideas that enable his stars to excel. He is known for strategically adjusting his matchups to capitalize on the opponent’s weaker spots and gain an advantage and is among the best coaches in the world at using his resources effectively. Additionally, Vigneault has a strong record in player development, which he demonstrated when he managed to get more out of Vancouver’s prospects and young talent. If the Predators are looking for an experienced coach with proven success in the NHL, Vigneault is a great option.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Claude Julien** *(62 years old)*

* Points Percentage: 58.7%
* Playoff Win-Loss Percentage: 54.4%
* Stanley Cup Appearances: 2 (**1**\-1)
* Made Playoffs in 52.6% of years coached
* Coached 100-point teams 26.3% of the time
* Jack Adams Award Winner (2008-9)

Claude Julien’s success as a coach speaks for itself, with a points percentage of 58.7% and a Stanley Cup championship with the Boston Bruins in 2011. He has also taken his teams to the playoffs ten times during his career, with deep runs in several of those appearances. One of Julien’s strengths is his ability to create a structurally sound defense, which he does through solid structures and systems. He prioritizes defense first but does not sacrifice offense in the process. His Bruins teams were one of the better possession teams in the NHL dating back to the 2012 lockout. With a deep and talented forward corps and the best goaltender in the world anchoring his defense, Julien’s strategic preferences could be a perfect fit for the Nashville Predators. Under Julien’s guidance, The Predators could challenge for the Stanley Cup in a matter of years once their young core develops.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Dan Bylsma** *(52 years old)*

* Points Percentage: 61.5%
* Playoff Win-Loss Percentage: 55.1%
* Stanley Cup Appearances: 1 (**1**\-0)
* Made Playoffs in 75% of years coached
* Coached 100-point teams 50% of the time
* Jack Adams Award Winner (2010-11)

Dan Bylsma could be the perfect fit for the Nashville Predators. With a points percentage of 61.5% and a playoff win-loss percentage of 55.1%, Bylsma has proven his worth as a head coach. He has led his teams to a Stanley Cup championship and made playoffs in 75% of years coached. He has also coached 100-point teams 50% of the time. He won the Jack Adams Award as the league’s most outstanding coach for the 2010-2011 season. Bylsma’s system emphasizes a north-south style of play and a cycle game, and his teams are known for their quick, long stretch passes. Although his system can be complicated and regimented, it has worked well for his teams in the past. Bylsma’s ability to motivate his players with quirky incentives, such as a shootout practice where the last player to score grows a mustache, could bring some much-needed fun to the Nashville locker room. Overall, Dan Bylsma’s track record of success and unique coaching style make him an excellent candidate for the Nashville Predators’ head coaching position.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bruce Boudreau** *(68 years old)*

* Points Percentage: 62.6%
* Playoff Win-Loss Percentage: 47.8%
* Stanley Cup Appearances: 0 (0-0)
* Made Playoffs in 62.5% of years coached
* Coached 100-point teams 50% of the time
* Jack Adams Award Winner (2007-8)

Former Vancouver Canucks head coach Bruce Boudreau could be an ideal fit for the Nashville Predators due to his experience, coaching accolades, and player development skills. As a former Jack Adams Award winner and a coach of four different NHL teams, Boudreau has shown that he can lead teams to success in the regular season, with a winning percentage that ranks him second in NHL history for coaches with at least 900 games coached. He has consistently finished above .500 and has turned around struggling teams midseason, such as when he took over the Washington Capitals in 2007 and led them to their first playoff appearance in five years. Boudreau is known for his ability to coach the offensive side of the game, utilizing a fast-paced, “run and gun” style of play that led to the success of players like Alexander Ovechkin and Nicklas Bäckström during his tenure with the Capitals. Boudreau’s coaching style has also helped players like Ryan Getzlaf, Nick Bonino, and Mikael Granlund have career years, and he made an impact on the Vancouver Canucks during his short time with the team. Overall, Boudreau’s coaching experience, accolades, and player development skills make him an excellent candidate to lead the Nashville Predators to success.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bob Hartley** *(62 years old)*

* Points Percentage: 55.4%
* Playoff Win-Loss Percentage: 56.8%
* Stanley Cup Appearances: 1 (**1**\-0)
* Made Playoffs in 50% of years coached
* Coached 100-point teams 16.6% of the time
* Jack Adams Award Winner (2014-15)

Bob Hartley could make an excellent head coach for the Nashville Predators. At 62 years old, Hartley has an impressive track record, including winning the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 2001 and the Jack Adams Award in 2014-15 as the NHL’s coach of the year. He has also won the Calder Cup and the NLA championship. Hartley’s style of coaching is defense-first, which could be a valuable asset for the Predators and fits their style historically. He is also known for being a strict disciplinarian, willing to bench even his star players for tardiness. His commitment to winning is evident through his tireless work and his outstanding motivation skills. Hartley could be a valuable addition to the Nashville Predators’ coaching staff, perhaps taking their hockey club to the next level.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Young Coaches:**

Another avenue is to recruit a promising young assistant coach who has been affiliated with successful NHL teams and has firsthand experience with winning cultures, strategies, and teams. With the newly appointed General Manager, Barry Trotz, assuming leadership, I believe that he could potentially mentor this coach throughout the entirety of the rebuild. All of the listed coaches will have substantial NHL experience, including time spent as a player.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Chris Kelly** *(42 years old) –* *Assistant coach for the Boston Bruins*

* NHL Games Played: 845
* NHL Point Shares: 24.1
* NHL Plus Minus: +40

During his playing career, Kelly was widely recognized for his two-way defensive forward style, earning him four nominations for the Selke Trophy, and securing a place in the top 30 of the voting category on three separate occasions. As a member of the Boston Bruins, Kelly also won the Stanley Cup in 2011, affording him a wealth of experience on a championship-winning team.

Since 2018, Kelly has transitioned to coaching, initially joining the Ottawa Senators as a development coach before being hired by the Boston Bruins in 2021. As part of one of the NHL’s most successful teams, Kelly has had the opportunity to observe first-hand the inner workings of a high-performing locker room and the strategies that drive such success. Throughout his career, Kelly has demonstrated a winning mindset, both as a player and a coach, making him a potentially valuable addition to the Nashville Predators.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Tim Gleason** *(40 years old) –* *Assistant coach to the Carolina Hurricanes*

* NHL Games Played: 727
* NHL Point Shares: 26.7
* NHL Plus Minus: -37

Tim Gleason, a former first-round pick from Ottawa and current assistant coach for the Carolina Hurricanes, represents a compelling prospect for a head coaching position. Known for his tough and gritty style of play during his playing days, Gleason was appointed as assistant coach to the Carolina Hurricanes on September 2nd, 2021, and has made an immediate impact.

As a member of the coaching staff for one of the NHL’s most high-scoring and electrifying teams, Gleason has had the opportunity to observe and contribute to the team’s significant success over the past few seasons. His role has been integral in developing the team’s strategies, tactics, and style of play, and his influence has been apparent on the ice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Manny Malhotra** *(42 years old)* – Assistant coach for the Toronto Maple Leafs

* NHL Games Played: 991
* NHL Point Shares: 20.8
* NHL Plus Minus: -26

Manny Malhotra, the former 7th overall pick in the 1998 NHL Draft, was widely recognized for his all-around play and sportsmanship throughout his playing career. He received votes for both the Byng and Selke Trophies on multiple occasions and won the OHL Scholastic Player of the Year award in ’98, as well as the Memorial Cup’s Most Sportsmanlike Player award the same year. Additionally, Malhotra holds the distinction of being the last active player to have been a teammate of Wayne Gretzky.

As a two-way forward, Malhotra was particularly known for his faceoff proficiency, winning over 56% of faceoffs he took in the NHL. After retiring from his playing career, Malhotra transitioned to coaching and was hired as an assistant coach for the Vancouver Canucks in June 2017. He later joined the coaching staff of the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2020, where he has gained valuable experience observing the strategies and tactics employed by successful NHL teams.

With several years of coaching experience under his belt and a deep understanding of what it takes to be successful in the NHL, Malhotra would be a strong candidate for a head coaching position.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Tuomo Ruutu** *(40 years old)* – Assistant coach with the Florida Panthers

* NHL Games Played: 735
* NHL Point Shares: 31.9
* NHL Plus Minus: -70

Tuomo Ruutu had a successful NHL career, having been drafted 9th overall in 2001 and finishing 6th in The Calder voting in his rookie season. Known for his rough style of play, Ruutu accumulated over 1500 career hits and was a hard competitor who enjoyed stirring up opponents. Ruutu was recently hired as an assistant coach with the Florida Panthers on June 29, 2021, after spending two years as Assistant Director of Player Development with the New York Rangers. As the Panthers have been one of the top teams in the NHL for the past few seasons, Ruutu has had the opportunity to be a part of their success. In addition, his experience in player development adds another area of expertise to his coaching abilities. Although Ruutu may be one of the more inexperienced candidates on this list, his unique background and skillset make him an intriguing candidate.",Apprehensive_Ad4572,2023-04-04 05:57:08

1722,734,129x89t,Ready for a face off …,"Well, it doesn’t get any easier with another game against another tough team in Dallas but let’s go!

In this last section of games, the Predators have still been forechecking hard but they have changed their approach some and have been playing very tough through the neutral zone. The forwards, whether they have been above or below the puck, have been hustling bery hard to jam things up through the middle.

Behind that, they have still been very good at guarding the middle of the ice. They give up a lot of zone possesion time but are not giving up anything easy and the goalies have played outstanding.

Offense has been tough to come by for the Preds until the Blues game but maybe they have made a breakthrough. The young players have been pretty creative and have some nice, subtle skills and maybe are getting more confidence.

It will be another hard game but it should be fun to watch.",evanwilliams212,2023-04-02 20:33:13

Hello, my name is Nick and an active user in this sub. I am also a parent of two wonderful kids that attend the covenant school here in Nashville. Hockey has been an amazing part of my children’s year, especially my 5 year old who wanted to be Saros when he grows up (until today, now he wants to be a policeman). Unfortunately, There are lots of scared and confused kids tonight, and hearing my kids, it is going to take a while to process the events from today. What I do know is that they are still kids.

I am looking for anyone that might have contacts or connects to the preds organization to try and do something for these kids and bring them a little joy. The students will not have school this week and I know parents are having a hard time just processing the day let alone what moving forward looks like. 

Any connections or any ideas… Ice skating for the families, kids meet gnash, see the locker rooms… anything to let them be kids. 

Thanks, smashville.",KaleidoscopeOk1346,2023-03-28 03:44:10

I have been planning a bachelor party for my best friend in Nash for months now and we’re really wanting to see our hometown team, St. Louis, play y’all next Saturday (4/1). I spoke to the box office a month ago, which is when i first learned about the blackout restrictions. It was suggested that I wait to purchase tickets until i was physically in Nashville but I learned today that the restriction is based on credit card billing address (VPN didn’t work). I’m starting to think that there is no way for us to get tickets but this game was one of the main reasons we chose this weekend.

Does anyone know how an out-of-town hockey fan could attend a Preds game with these restrictions? I’ve tried resellers like StubHub and SeatGeek but they’ve all failed. Are we totally SOL here? Any advice is more than welcome, even if it’s to just give up and find a good bar to watch from lol.

Sincerely,
A desperate Blues fan

1775,787,12050io,Is what the broadcast said about Tolvanen’s waiver situation true?,"Early in tonight’s broadcast, I swear I thought I heard Willy or Mace say something along the lines of “Tolvanen actually was passed on by 20~ teams before being claimed by Seattle” (please correct me if I misheard)

I thought that was really interesting, but had never heard of him being “passed” on or whatnot. 

I can’t find a source on that claim. I’m guessing I don’t understand how the waiver wire works? Where was Seattle in there and do they just ask every team in order if they wanna pick up x player?

This isn’t a Willy or Mace hate post by the way, I’m just really curious about what I thought I heard and wondering if it was true. 

I found this tweet from December from Sean Shapiro, an editor for a hockey news site, in which he says that Nashville was “internally pretty confident he would clear (waivers)”

Additionally, being on hockey twitter, I’ve seen fans of just about every team complain that their team didn’t claim Tolvanen lol",-midnightflyer-,2023-03-24 01:39:45

1781,793,11zpugw,Saros or Rinne?,"I think Saros on a team in a larger hockey market would be touted as McJesus in the pipes. It does make me wonder- is Saros better than Rinne? Rinne was a damn magician and I remember worrying when Saros would get the odd game to play, but I didn’t watch as religiously back then as I do now. Would love some opinions here from folks who did. I feel like we had some better blue liners than current, these young guys are fun, but damn do those zone turnovers kill the mood.

It’s such a luxury to only have to worry about leaky goaltending the first 10 games of the season with him. Can’t believe we have a line of Rinne-Saros-Askarov (as well as a usually steady Lankinen who may not get many starts as long as we have a playoff hope).",KaleidoscopeOk1346,2023-03-23 16:39:59

Spoiler: They say we should go after a prime RFA. 

It’s not the worst idea in the world. We have a lot of draft capital for the next 3 years and a decent amount of cap room. So it’s definitely possible. 

I’d be interested to hear who everyone thinks would be a good target for the Preds. My top 5: Zegras, Caufield, DeBrincat, K’Andre Miller, & Terry. 

Time Meier is an RFA, but his qualifying offer is $10 million. So he’s probably going to want around that in his new long term deal.",Seib7290,2023-03-22 15:03:50

When the Jets were about to be swept by the Ducks the fans still cheered them on right to the end, during the handshake and as they left the ice. I loved seeing the Preds fans that stuck around to do that for their team. Because the players appreciate it and will remember it.

Predators are a great team and have a loud barn like us. It sucks that this wasn’t a conference final like it should be. Having the #1 and #2 teams in the league meet in Round 2 is silly.

I tip my hat to both the true fans and the team itself for a crazy unpredictable series. It was a clash of titans that made the analyst scratch their heads because they never knew what would happen next.

2679,7,c585mq,Corey Perry (and why I think Poile should sign him),"We all know Perry from all of our Anaheim series, and most of us hated him. I wouldn't call him dirty (ala kesler), but more of a troll that can get under peoples skin easily.

With that aside, hate him or not, its a pretty low risk high reward situation with Perry. If Poile can sign him for 1-2x1, I think he should. He has been on a decline with his knee injury bolstering that, however even on a crappy Ducks team, playing bottom six minutes (last season), he produced 10 points in 31 games. Now, clearly that is quite bad, however if he plays 62 games (if he doesnt get hurt/take games off it could be more) He could net anywhere from 15-30 points (leaning closer to 30 imo). Compared to guys who usually play bottom 6 minutes, hes pretty equal if not better. He would easily replace Salamaki, who is clearly worse, putting up 7 in 37 games this year. If you want a comparable in terms of points, I think he will land somewhere near Calle Jarnkrok (26 points in 79gp). 

If Poile can sign Perry on a cheap, one year deal, I think it is worth it, regardless of how much we've loathed him in the past. Who knows, maybe he has a really good year and puts up ~40 or something. He's easily better than FreddyG and Salamaki, and brings some attitude and grit, which we could use since Subban is gone.

Upsides: A scoring winger to throw on our top line in lieu of Smith. Slightly less $$$ and slightly less term for players past their prime. We know Neal works in Nashville, chemistry is there.

Downsides: Neal had an abysmal season last year and his strong start could be an anomaly. He's a little older as well, so even if he bounces back, we might see production fall off again in coming years.

2708,36,34rmwn,Trade idea,"Seth Jones for Nugent-Hopkins

Before you call me crazy let me set up both teams take on the trade.

Edmonton:

They have an abundance of top 6 centers now, with Nuge, Draisaitl, and McDavid. Edmonton will likely move one of Draisaitl or Nuge, and the reason I think it will be Nuge is for one reason: Roy really helped the development of Yakupov, and unless they trade Nuge or McDavid away, Roy will be on the third line. Edmonton needs defensemen, and Jones would be a perfect acquisition for them as he is young, and he has a year left on his entry-level contract. Darnell Nurse could be their #1 dman, but he is still several years away from that, and Jones is much closer to that role right now. 

Nashville:

We need a young, future first line center, with both Ribeiro and Fisher likely gone in the next few years. Nuge is 21, and he has a very good contract (7 year, 42M), especially if he develops chemistry with Neal and Forsberg. We have an abundance of young-dmen, with Josi, Ellis, Ekholm, and Jones all below 25, and Weber is only 29. I think Jones will be the odd man out, for me at least because I don't think he will develop to his potential when he is always behind Weber and Josi, and his trade value will decrease as time goes on. There are also several d-men that we can sign in free-agency that can fill the 5-6 role. 

Cap Issues?

The one reason that I wouldn't want to make this trade is that the Preds would be taking on several million in cap space. As it currently stands, if we let all our RFAs and UFA go, we would have 27.77M in cap space (cap ceiling at 70M). obviously we wouldn't do this, and after the trade we would have 24.5M in cap space (with the bonuses on Seth Jones' contract). Fisher and Ribeiro will likely take ~3M contracts, and Jarnkrok, Beck, and Bourque would all take ~1M bridge deals. that leaves us with 15.5M in cap space. Smith and Wilson will probably take ~4.5M contracts, leaving us with 6.5M in cap space to either sign free agents, or resign players like Cullen and Volchenkov. We also have bad contracts in Gaustad, Stalberg, and Nystrom that we could try to trade away for draft picks or prospects to clear up cap space.",Kidparkinsons,2015-05-03 23:38:57

Edmonton desprately needs another goaltender, and Lankinen (.920 sv%) is having a great year. He would be a legit upgrade from Campbell who currently has a .888 save percentage.

I hear a lot of pundits blaming the offense of the defense or the AK/Rads situation for the poor performance and lack of win against Phoenix.  I've also heard that Rinne is a $49 million hunk of Swiss cheese.  I personally love to blame Klein when things get low.  But that's not really the problem, is it?

Look at what we have as far as talent.  Rinne, Weber, Suter, Radulov, AK/SK, Gill, Gaustad, Halischuck, Hornqvuist, Erat, the list of real talent goes on and on.  So why can't Trotz get any performance out of this team.  Hell, even without Rads and AK we nailed Phoenix to the ice; dead to rights.

The answer is:

We are not a team.  We're a mixed bag of talent running around the ice and most of the time that works out.  That is, except when the chips are down.  I had my suspicion that things were awry but the real confirmation came when the news broke that AK and Rads were off the reservation, doing their own thing; the wrong thing.

...and like a death-bed repentance, the team pulled together and said, ""Look at us, we can do it.  We're a team!""  Then the next game they were back to their old tricks because like a death-bed repentance, they really didn't mean it.

There is a distinct lack of coaching on this team.  Not from the standpoint of making the play or honing skills and talent - but for the lack of camaraderie and team building.  Look at the Preds play.  They always seem to be just out of sync - missing passes, failing set-ups, rebound?, defense.  They are not working together as a team should - they don't seem to know each other well enough to make that play or catch that rebound, or read the play together.  THAT is a lack of coaching.

You've got players on the road running off alone or in pairs instead of being together as a team, learning each other, loving each other, building chemistry and bonds.  Rads and AK did not lose this series for us; Trotz did.  He allowed the team to roam free instead of tightening up the bonds among ice-mates.  Clearly there is no rule for being a team, there is no practice for being a team - just a bunch of talent; talent that ain't worth squat if it can't work together.

Also Klein.

I don't know if this is the right place to post or even allowed, but wanted to see if there was any interest in people hanging out for the Preds game tonight in my twitch stream.  I am an up and coming, albeit small, streamer that normally streams Final Fantasy 14, but am a huge Preds fan and thought of an idea to stream myself with the box score on my screen (of course game will be on another screen as to not break ToS of Twitch and violate any NHL policies.) Figured it could be a cool way to chat, drink some beers with other preds fans, and watch the game together.

If there is any interest, let me know.  You can drop a follow on my twitch page at http://twitch.tv/nuckifyabuck  I am looking at going live tonight at 8:30 CST for a little pregame talk.

2805,133,zoparz,My thoughts,So a lot of thoughts right now on the subreddit.  So what do y’all think of leave things as they are for a few years get a few picks of 1-4 in the draft and then win the cup.  Basically do what Colorado did.  I mean 5 years of suck and they turned it around. Say we are in year 1 now only 4 to go till we dominate again! Plus by keeping things the same we save money with Poile and Hynes and then can then replace them before we get good.,coltssiouxfan,2022-12-18 03:55:54

2811,139,6h8eee,Trading Roman Josi,"I'm a Bruins fan at heart, but the Preds have been my #2 since the 2011-12 season where they took down Detroit in 5 games. I want to hear the opinions and feedback of everyone in this sub.

Full disclosure- this will not happen, and I hope it does not happen...

Trade Roman Josi.

He is the future captain of this team, on a fantastic deal, and a fan favorite. But given Nashville's position in the expansion draft, and his contract renegotiations pending- the Preds could net a top-6 draft exempt forward, picks and a wealth of prospects for him. 

He is a #1 defenseman on most teams, but Subban is this teams #1 defenseman. I know a lot would disagree, but he is better offensively, and offers much more than Josi in the defensive zone. 

If the Preds traded him- they would only need to protect 3 defenseman, and could use 7 on forwards protecting Johansen, Arvidsson, Forsberg, Neal, Jarnkrok, Wilson, Scissons/Aberg.

They could target a defenseman in FA this summer- like Karl Alzner, or look at other trades using other assets to slot on the left side with Ryan Ellis on the second pairing.

Something like: 

- Josi to Tampa for Drouin, picks, and an A-level prospect

- Josi to Edmonton for RNH and Puulijarvi

- Josi to Philadelphia for Couturier, LaBerge, Haag/Morin and picks. 

- Josi to Montreal for Galchenyuk and Sergachev

Again, I don't think this will happen, and I hope to buy a Josi jersey with a C on it one day... but I'm curious what you all think. ",Rusty_Bojangles,2017-06-14 15:56:36

The Rouge is out of step with the fan base. For me it signals a disrespect for the locals. Try to fill up Bridgestone with tourists for every game and see what happens. We already decided not to renew after this year but this move is solidifying that decision.

Personally it’s just pretentious. Like driving in a street or road isn’t enough so you have to go out and be driving on ice. Then that isn’t enough so you have to drive around and be obnoxious.

Honestly they are slow. Nashville infrastructure is shitty. Downtown near the arena roads are small. It’s already jam packed with hundreds(thousands?) of people. It’s the equivalent of someone paying with pennies in front of you.

2835,163,f91baq,Considering leaving the sub,"There is too much negativity here.  It's really discouraging to see what our fanbase has devolved into since we became relevant 4 years ago.  It's like people forget that the season we went to the Cup finals we entered as an 8 seed that was supposed to be an easy out.  Now here we sit, 1 point out of that same seed with 3 games in hand, or 2 points out and 4 games in hand.  The guys everyone was dead set on trading (Smith, Granlund, and Bonino) are playing lights out for us at the moment and the guys we can usually count on (Joey, Arvy, Forsberg) are struggling, which means there's a clear road to improvement.  Not to mention all the guys with real potential who could get it clicking at any moment.  Instead this sub wants to focus on how we need to ""get rid"" of one of the greatest GMs we could ever hope to have because he didn't overpay for a depth guy (which he is notoriously bad at doing) or blow it all up.  It just makes me sad to come here and see all this negativity just because we aren't winning the President's trophy or leading the division.  This fanbase has become too spoiled.

EDIT: To clarify something, I'm not saying I don't like seeing criticism. I realize the team is not living up to expectations and it's fine to be frustrated with that.  All I'm saying is that we are coming off of the best 3 season stretch in Nashville's history, there's bound to be a regression to the mean.  If the response as a fanbase is to call for the firing of every person that got us here and to sell off all our assets regardless of the return just so we don't lose them for free.... why would people want to come here?  Look at what has happened in Knoxville.  They weren't able to attract top candidates for their head football coach because of how toxic that fanbase is.  What I was really hoping to do was get people to think twice about their short memories and knee jerk reactions, which it seems like there's a refreshing number of people doing, but there are plenty of ""don't let the door hit you"" or ""gtfo, we don't care about you"" attitudes which is discouraging from fellow fans.",SSGSSFlows,2020-02-25 00:30:59

So, I am making this post to warn /r/Predators users about joining the discord server linked on the sidebar of this subreddit, and I am requesting that /r/Predators mods take appropriate action.

The Discord channel was created by an ex-mod of /r/Predators, /u/--Fulcrum. Who said he specifically created the Discord channel to ""escape"" /r/predators and it's users, [here.](https://i.imgur.com/ssDaCG7.png) 

In fact, /u/--Fulcrum said that the Discord server was meant ONLY for him and his friends, that it is NOT meant for predators fans from r/predators, [here.](https://i.imgur.com/OZfdXku.png) 


#**Why users of /r/Predators should care:**

1. The Discord server is being used to doxx reddit users. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/igTGYrn.png), Discord user ""asparagus"" is encouraging Discord mods to doxx IP addresses. Something tells me this is not this first time /u/--Fulcrum has done this either. We can only be thankful that he is no longer a mod of /r/Predators.

1. The Discord channel is currently being used to [brigade posts.] (https://i.imgur.com/7Cwmbcw.png) [Here](https://i.imgur.com/aqb79AM.png), reddit user /u/kithoo posted an /r/Predators thread from yesterday and encourages Discord users to brigade it. Again, this is not the first time this has happened.


1. The Discord channel is being used for TARGETED harassment of /r/Predators members. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/J2RKdA8.png), u/--Fulcrum (Discord mod) and u/ihategage (Discord mod) are targeting /u/oldschoolpredsfan just for stating his opinion on a Reddit thread? [Here](https://i.imgur.com/oPXEBF4.png) is another /r/Predators member u/HomeRahn taunting /u/oldschoolpredsfan.


1. Users in the Discord channel are combing through comment histories of /r/Predators users to harass, doxx and mock them on BOTH reddit and Discord. The Discord channel spent the past day bitching about /r/Predators users [/u/lobsterwithcrabs](https://i.imgur.com/1l9GKmt.png) and again [/u/oldschoolpredsfan](https://i.imgur.com/xXh6tFI.png).



1. All of this was SANCTIONED and APPROVED by the /r/Predators mod team. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/kzr8RbD.png) you can see /r/Predators mod /u/c3ndre was getting in on the action! Good work /u/c3ndre! [Here](https://i.imgur.com/tnIx5Vp.png) he is encouraging all of this!


Again, will any of /r/Predators mods care to explain why this Discord server is on the sidebar of this subreddit? Why is this Discord channel being promoted by the automod? I would ask mod /u/c3ndre but we know where he stands on this issue.


All of these users, are breaking MULTIPLE site-wide Reddit rules as well as MULTIPLE /r/Predators rules:

* /u/c3ndre

* /u/ihategage

* /u/--Fulcrum

* /u/HomeRahn

* /u/kithoo

Maybe the r/predators subreddit should not be promoting or participating in that Discord channel anymore? Just a thought...


**Edit #1:**

lol@ /u/vorin for tagging my post as ""misleading"", there is NOTHING misleading about any of it, pathetic.

I have said it in the comments below, but I will re-state it here:

It is very clear that something NEEDS to be done, I am just not sure the /r/Predators mods are willing to do anything. We certainly know we can't count on /u/c3ndre to help.

At the very least, this subreddit should ENTIRELY disaffiliated from a Discord server it has no control over.

If the users of /r/predators want a discord channel, it should be run by the /r/predators mod team. That is how majority of all the other team-affiliated subreddits handle their ""official"" Discord channels.

**Edit #2:** 

I have been receiving messages from users that their comments replying to the /u/vorin stickied comment are being deleted.

**Edit #3:** 

While I am glad to see the r/predators mods have disassociated this subreddit from that cancerous discord server, it is quite telling that (as of yet) no actions have been taken against the r/predators users and the r/predators mod who were admittedly behind all of this. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/oqK5Ktt.png) are the rules in case anyone needs a refresher. I think this subreddit would feel a lot safer if those offending users were no longer a part of this community.

**Edit #4:**

So, for everyone wondering, yes, there was brigading and harassing happening. [/u/--fulcrum has admitted it in is his rambling non-apology.](https://i.imgur.com/QqOQui5.png) Unfortunately, he also said that he would not do anything to stop it. A comment from any one of the r/predators mods would be nice...

With Poile's good history of trades with OTT I think the he could have come up with a package that included Tolvanen (perhaps with Fiala and a pick). If Ottawa insisted on a defenseman I'm sure the Preds had one to spare. I'm not digging up the roster to look, though. I firmly believe Stone would've had a bigger impact than the combination of Granlund (for Fiala) and Simmonds (for Harttman) that the Preds traded for at the deadline. I think Poile was too caught up in the idea of finally having drafted a potentially legit top line forward to let him go.

I would also love to see Karl Taylor move up to a Head coach and let go of Hynes. I think Hynes has been great at getting an identity going but for some reason the consistency isn’t there. If we are going full rebuild I think Taylor is the man for the job. He has done a great job developing the young players in the AHL. I think we need to find sign-trade options for Forsberg and try and get a first rounder if possible and a pretty decent prospect. I think tradable assets are Ekholm, Duchene, and Joey. I think their contracts are just a little too big and I think we should sell while they have decent value. I think we could get 1sts for each of these guys especially if we retain salary. Or with Joey a second and a prospect. I would like to just let the young guys develop. I would get rid of Cousins and Dave. Maybe even Boro and Benning just so we can get some youth back into the D-Core and let guys like Davies and Farrance get shots at being regulars in the NHL. For the love of god get Ben Harpur as far away as possible from this team. I think if we get as many young assets and picks as possible the more likely we will be to get top end talent. If we can get picks for this year’s draft and the next 2-3 drafts especially if we can get 1st rounders there are lots of players in those drafts that could instantly speed up this rebuild. I know Josi is going to get older but I just can’t imagine him waiving his NMC to get traded but anything could happen.",mk1700,2022-05-10 05:40:47

We currently have one opening left in a 31 Team Dynasty Fantasy Hockey League that is set to kick off after the All-Star Break and we are looking for someone to take over the Predators. We just began full transactions (trades, call-ups, send-downs, ETC...) a few days ago.

We will be using the remainder of the current 2019-20 season for teams to get accustomed to the format and structure, while building their teams in preparation for the 2020-21 season.

The league is active year round and we are seeking owners who can manage a team year round. Off-season duties include drafting, signing free agents, trades, etc...

To start, you will take over the Predators, owning their full roster, cap hits, prospects, etc... Over time, each team will become the owner's own as they draft rookies, release players, sign free agents, make trades, etc. Some teams will completely diversify, while others will make minor tweaks. The choice is yours!

Fantrax, Proboards, Google Sheets and Discord will all be used for different aspects of the league.

$30 league fee paid through Fantrax Treasurer. $30 prize pool will roll over to the 2020-21 season due to the short amount of time left in the 2019-20 fantasy hockey season.

I just don't understand how a team can hold onto a GM who acts like Ken Holland (even though most of his success, if not all, is due to Devellano) and yet doesn't have a Stanley Cup to show for his efforts. I know they got screwed in Game 6 of that Finals, but what makes him think he can continue to build for a deep playoff run when they get swept in the 1st round and that adding a 32, now 33, year old defenseman is the answer? He let Ben Harpur go, who has been great for the Rangers, puts Eeli Tolvanen on waivers, and apparently 5-6 days ago, he finally admits the team needs a rebuild!?!? Why is he still there? Also, I love physicality, but it seems like it's just being physical for the sake of being physical. I feel like the team is the American version of Calgary at this point. I know Bill Haslam is supposed to be taking over as the owner, but I don't really see a hardcore conservative making a big change.

But all that time I swore I would switch allegiances to Seattle if they were ever to get a hockey team since I spent a third of my life in that state and never even lived in Tennessee. 

Well, it finally happened guys. We’re Kraken fans now. I live in Arkansas now and my wife decided that a great anniversary gift would be to get us tickets for the game the day after our anniversary. That’s right, my first NHL game I’ll attend will be my new team against the team I cheered for over a decade. I’m sorry. 

Now the tricky part. My wife unknowingly bought us tickets in Section 303. She had no idea. I just found out today and let her know all about it and how I always wanted to go to Bridgestone and sit in that section. I beg of you, please don’t hassle the couple wearing Krakens gear.

Presuming that Cooley will be available, he could pay wing next year and that is a position of need for us. Cooley is only 5'10"", but so is Granlund. 

Or you could draft Slafkovsky, and have a 6'4"" legit scoring threat. If we resign Forsberg, then we would have a legit LW for the 2nd line. If Forsberg doesnt sign, we would have his replacement on the first line.

I have read that New Jersey would really like a goalie. When you consider that we have Askarov expected to arrive in the next couple of years, I think it would it make sense to trade Saros for the #2 pick. As a Vesnia finalist, I believe he would be worth the #2 pick for an even swap when you conisider his contract is $5MM/year with 3 years left. I love Saros, but the moment we drafted Askarov his days in Nashville were numbered. I don't think we will get a better return for him than we could with a deal like this. We could then find a bridge goalie in free agency, like a Marc-Andre Fleury, until Askarov gets here. 

We have virtually no chance of getting a top 5 pick in the forseeable future because Poile is committed to a 'competitive rebuild', so the only way we will get top level talent is to trade for a top pick. It is rare for any team in the top 5 to consider trading out of their spot.

2949,277,ylcsu3,"You may no like it, but this is what peak GMing looks like.","A bunch of fellow fans seem to be confused and upset about the Tomasino situation, and I’m not saying you’re unjustified. This season has been abysmal at best so far. 

Generally though, when situations don’t make apparent sense, there’s usually deeper details unknown. 

As I’m sure many who are frustrated know, Tomasino had a breakout season last year, gaining 32 points over 79 games. Easy to justify a Preds roster spot, especially over some of the other players we’ve seen this year.

Philip is currently 21 years old. According to CapFriendly.com, the NHL’s waiver rules state anyone over 20 loses a year of waiver exemption if they play even ONE game. I don’t fully understand all of the wrinkles of the waiver system, but this seems pretty cut and dry. 

Tomasino currently has two years of waiver exemption left. That’s two years that no other team can take away an obviously young offensive talent. 

He also loses that exemption if he plays 81 more games, which could possibly be the 22-23 season. I know it doesn’t look that way, but it’s early folks. 

Back when the expansion draft happened, many fellow fans, including myself, were scratching our heads as to some of the players Poile decided to protect. 

We now know why these choices were made, and I’m sure anyone reasonable will agree, that those moves were risky, but smart. 

I also think most will agree that Poile has done a good job refilling our prospect pool, adding several promising skill players for the future of this team. 

If Poile doesn’t believe this team is fully ready to make a cup run this season, he’d be foolish not to take advantage of these kind of loopholes built into the rules. 

Regardless of anyone’s opinion of Poile’s tenure in the NHL, no one can deny his savvy for making the rights moves when most people haven’t a clue. That’s why he’s the GM, and we just vent on Reddit.",hacksawl_goodman,2022-11-03 19:51:04

Put Forsberg on the trading block, show the young kids nobody's irreplaceable. He's getting older and slower anyway, let him go to a team that can use him in a trap offense instead of forcing a heavy forecheck on him. 

Let Johansen go to the Kraken since he's been a crybaby since Columbus drafted him, complaining that he wants to be on a contending team and then does absolutely nothing to genuinely contribute.  7 goals and 15 assists during the regular season, and he wants to act like a top-liner. Get out of here.

Invest in the FUTURE of the team, as Poile has said so many times. The future is that young roster. Get them more involved, hold them to higher standards. If you won't contribute, you're on the bench or you're going back to the AHL if it's a repeat offense.

This team has gotten remarkably lazy, and to hear them sound like they're accepting entry to the playoffs as some great reward for their work? No way. Your reward is the Cup, anything else is an L.",Unknown,2021-05-21 03:46:03

So does he get the call-up after 9 games, then stay healthy scratch until he's ready, or do we try to keep him on Milwaukee and hope the prospect of NHL Glory keeps him here? Do we play him anyway on a 3rd or 4th line? Is he a bust, as some have declared? ",mansock18,2018-10-18 13:55:18

2965,293,ummfgc,My way to early predictions for next season,"Morning after being swept, still feels awful, but not it doesn’t leave a sour taste in my mouth as I kinda expected to lose, but never thought we’d be getting swept. 

Anyways, looking to next year, there’s a lot of ways this can go. I for one, think if there’s any year to tank, this is it. Bedard/michkov are some of the best prospects since mcdavid (supposedly) and it’s pretty clear this core is past it’s prime. So, here’s my armchair gm takes for you guys.

• keep the same bottom 6. Both the herde line and the diaper line (Tommy, glass, tolvy) I thought looked good. Especially that diaper line that can lead the charge in a few years. 

• guys I’d trade/let go Forsberg, Ekholm, kunin, ryjo/ duchene. I can see both ryjo/duchene being gone under new management eventually. Could throw granlund in here but I’d like to see him stay for a few more years. 

• UFA’s! With the cap space would save, we can make a run at some big time UFA’s that are young. Boeser, Necas, dach, Dubois?

2967,295,pt9yuc,2021 NHL Mock Realignment Draft: Nashville's Pick,"Welcome to the 2021 NHL Realignment Mock Draft! A hypothetical process where we take a look at how divisions might look like if instead of working together for the best interests of all teams, we let teams choose it for themselves. I'm going to randomize an order of selections and then go into the team subreddits, and get their fans to draft their divisions.

How does it work? Well, when it is their turn to pick, a team can choose any other team to join themselves in until we have 8 pods of four teams. That means a team that isn’t joined to any other team can join a solo team, a group of two or a group of three, and a team that is in a group of two can only join another group of two or a solo team, etc. Also no team can make a pick that will make it impossible for the draft to work out evenly (eg. if there are 8 groups of 3 already, a solo team can’t pick another solo team and make a group of two). And then once there are 8 pods of 4, I’m going to have the next teams in line pick to join their pod to any other pod and we’ll have our final divisions of 8 teams.

IMPORTANT DRAFTING NOTE: When selecting for your team, please keep in mind what you think your team will actually do, and not what you’d want them to do. Does your ownership/fanbase value a rivalry, or having less travel, or being with teams from the same time zone? Pick based on those things. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER TEAM’S INTERESTS TO MAKE YOUR PICK. This is meant to be completely selfish.

I will randomize the order of picks. The twenty-fifth pick goes to the Nashville Predators

Preds fans, please tell me which group of four teams you most would like to have in your division with you. Highest upvoted comment will be the pick I go with. As this is the third pick of this round, you have the option of three other groups of four to pick from only. (NYR-NYI-WPG-MIN or BOS-FLA-ANA-SJ or LA-EDM-AZ-COL)

DRAFT SO FAR:

-1st pick: Arizona chooses the LA Kings

-2nd pick: Winnipeg chooses the Minnesota Wild

-3rd pick: Columbus chooses the Detroit Red Wings

-4th pick: Carolina chooses the Nashville Predators

-5th Pick: Colorado chooses the LA/Arizona pair

-6th Pick: Chicago chooses Detroit (and Columbus)

-7th Pick: Buffalo chooses the Toronto Maple Leafs

-8th Pick: Washington chooses the Pittsburgh Penguins

-9th Pick: Vegas chooses the Seattle Kraken

-10th Pick: New York Islanders choose the New York Rangers

-11th Pick: Ottawa chooses the Buffalo/Toronto pair

12th Pick: Seattle chooses the Vancouver Canucks

13th Pick: Dallas takes the Nashville/Carolina pair

-14th Pick: Vancouver chooses the Philadelphia Flyers

-15th Pick: Tampa Bay chooses the Nashville/Carolina/Dallas trio

-16th Pick: Minnesota chooses the Rangers/Islanders pair

-17th Pick: Detroit chooses the Montreal Canadiens

-18th Pick: St. Louis chooses the Toronto/Ottawa/Buffalo group

-19th Pick: Florida chooses the Boston Bruins

-20th pick: New Jersey chooses the Pittsburgh/Washington pair

-21st Pick: Edmonton chooses the LA/Colorado/Arizona trio

-22nd Pick: Pittsburgh chooses the Calgary Flames. As a result, Anaheim and San Jose have to be placed with Boston/Florida

-23rd Pick: Philadelphia makes a final division of VGK/SEA/VAN/PHI/WSH/NJ/PIT/CGY

I was skeptical since it showed the free coffee in the app but not the free donut and sure enough I got charged for the donut.  So lesson is if it doesn't show in the app you aren't going to get it.

So why don't we skip the pain and risk associated with a long-term rebuild required to draft one of those talents and take advantage of the rare opportunity to grab one already developed at 24 years old with cost certainty?

We have the cap space. We have the draft picks that Buffalo wants. We have the desire to win while rebuilding the core.

Have you ever found yourself watching your favorite hockey player and thinking, “Wow, I wish I could do that”? Well, do we have good news for you! In the Victory Hockey League (VHL) you have the opportunity to create your very own ice-hockey player.

For over 15 years, the VHL has offered people the chance to create, train, and manage their very own professional ice hockey player. As a forum-based hockey league, users can earn weekly experience points (TPE) either with a couple of easy clicks or by writing stories, creating graphics, and even producing podcasts. All of which can add to the story of your player. Once you’ve earned these points you can apply them to your player. Want to be a playmaker? Load up on passing! Do you want to drive to the net with the puck on a string? Increase your Stick Handling and Deking. It's your player, your career, your choice.

One of the greatest parts of the VHL is that we are a diverse community of hockey fans who share a common interest in building players, creating stories, and watching our very own players make it to the Hall of Fame. As a user, you also have the chance to manage a team, create lines, negotiate contracts, and much more.

All of our games are run through the Simon T Hockey Simulator, and when the season is in full swing you can expect daily simulations, some chirping, and a lot of fun. Watch as your player grows from being someone no one knows in the Victory Hockey League Minors, to a rising star in the Victory Hockey League Europe, and finally a superstar in the Victory Hockey League.

No matter what, even if you just want to check us out, we have a great community of people who will help you learn, answer your questions, and may even become some of your greatest friends.

This is a perfect pass time for a long NHL Offseason! To find out more join our Discord server [https://discord.gg/pn8rkSuM](https://discord.gg/pn8rkSuM) and visit our website, [vhlforum.com](https://vhlforum.com/).",OfficialVHL,2022-06-13 00:22:00

3071,399,oqbt9z,"How is a ""competitive rebuild"" different from a flat-out rebuild?","The Flyers have now traded for Ryan Ellis and Rasmus Ristolainen. The return for Ellis was two prospects that are on the cusp on being full time NHLers: Cody Glass (2017 6OA, projected 2nd or 3rd line center) and Phillipe Myers (undrafted, probably 3-4D), while the return for Ristolainen was two high draft picks: 2021 13thOA and 2022 2nd round. Ellis ($6.25 x 6yr remaining) is a much better player than Ristolainen ($5.4M x 1yr remaining), although the term of Ellis' contract is probably not going to age well. So why did Ristolainen fetch similar value to Ellis?

Just look back at that ""competitive rebuild"" phrase that GMDP threw out: if you want to be competitive you need players on the roster. We probably could've gotten better overall value if we got draft picks back for Ellis, but sacrificed a bit of future value to get players who are ready now. If GMDP has more trades in the works don't expect many draft picks, he's looking at prospects.",lumenrubeum,2021-07-23 21:20:32

3077,405,11ga0xw,"I don't want to lose Saros, but if we are going to trade him, please let our trade partner be Buffalo.","If we are going to move him, I would love for our trade partner to be Buffalo. They have SOOOO many prospects in Buffalo, and plenty of picks. They are 3 points behind PIT for the last wild card postion, and Saros could absolutely give them a lift to make the playoffs. If they don't make the playoffs, their pick would obviously be worth more to us. 

Buffalo has a 1st and three 2nd round picks this year. 

It probably would never happen, but could you imagine if we got Owen Power and their 2023 1st for Saros? We could even send them McDonagh in the deal to give them the leadership they probably need in a playoff run and to fill Power's spot in the lineup. They have the cap space for McDonagh. They actually have enough young D-men that they can afford to lose him.

They also have the following prospects on The Hockey Writers top 100 list:

20. Kulich

23. Savoie

50. Ostlund

74. Rosen

As a point of reference, we only have the following:

13. Kemell

29. Evangelista

[https://thehockeywriters.com/nhl-top-100-prospects-ranking/](https://thehockeywriters.com/nhl-top-100-prospects-ranking/)

We could accelerate our rebuild by picking up players a little further along in their development than players we would draft this year. 

Take Kulich as an example. Kulich is an 18 year old with 33(15g-18a) points in 43 games in the AHL this year. As a point of comparison, Evangelista has 41 points (9g-32a) in 44 AHL games as a 21 year old. Kulich's production is nuts for an 18 year old. He also scored 8 goals in 10 games at U20 this year as an 18 year old. Kulich probably could play in the NHL next year, or this year if playing him in the NHL wouldn't kill his development. He will absolutely be a top 6 winger in the future.",MusicCityJayhawk,2023-03-02 18:30:13

He and the team continue to play like we know they can play and bring Nashville to the stanley cup finals where they meet the Montreal Canadiens. Pk Subban collects 10 points and the game 7 OT winner at the bell centre as the predators win their first stanley cup. Suga Shea plays well and radulov goes 0/5 on breakaways in the series. Ryjo(e Thornton) wins the conn smythe and leads the playoffs in assists. Turns out Juicy Jusse is literally Tom Brady. He, the JOFA line, and the top 4D combine to become the NHL equivalent of the patriots dysnasty going 5/7 in the cup finals in 16 years and Lavi begins to wear a short sleeve hoodie 24/7. Pekka happily takes on a backup up role as he loves jusse and realizes he's getting old and he still plays like 35 games (think fleury/Murray). Eventually to retire and join the coaching staff.

For a team that is supposed to have one of the best d-cores in the league, I’m not seeing it and I believe it starts with the coach. I was never a fan of the hire from the start based on his overall record as a coach, only made the playoffs once outside of last year and if the season hadn’t ended when it did, I think they wouldn’t have made it to the playoffs. He has a #1 line (JOFA line) that is very capable for putting the puck in the net but outside of Forsberg, have done almost nothing this year. Duchene is a very talented center and under this system is almost invisible out there.

3114,442,33q47b,My week as a preds fan,"It all started the night of game 2 of the series. I got drunk and had been drinking for most of the afternoon in fact until a buddy decided we should turn on some playoff hockey. I watched in awe as this nashville team demolished some team called the blackhawks 6-2. 

For background sake, I had never really gotten into hockey before that night but something about the way the game went got me and i was hooked. 

Later after the game around 3 AM i was still drinking and decided to be a preds fan. This of course to drunk me meant i had to commit. At 3 AM that night i fired up ebay and bought a large 2007 radulov jersey( new in the packaging of course) in the morning sober me realized what i had done and at that point i knew there was no turning back. I was crushed by the game 3 defeat and after 5 hours almost in tears after game 4 went on to be the longest game in franchise history. 

Fast foward to game 5 day. At 3pm i get notification a package was delivered and couldnt believe my eyes when i opened the package to find my preds jersey had arrived a week before expected. I celebrated with some heavy sexual activity with the first period playing in the background before getting fried chicken and heading back to my buddy's room where my jersey was. I put on that jersey at the beginning of the 3rd period and bowed before the almighty preds as a wave of deja vu swept over me in the form of 3 quick sucession goals. 

Ive got a good feeling about taking it to game 7 and crushing the blackhawks like twigs. Either way ill be a hockey and preds fan for as long as i live.

My next step is to research the team and get into how we play, roster, staff, history, you name it i want to know it.

3124,452,sut5di,Potential solution to the penalty problem?,"Ok, so we have a penalty problem. It's like we are chasing the white rhino and just can't enough of the box. It's a bit unfair. You know it, I know it, Hynes knows it.   


The problem isn't that the team is too physical or that the refs are being one-sided here. The problem is perception. We all saw the numerous missed calls against the Caps on Tuesday. It's because the refs weren't paying attention to US when the Caps were throwin' elbows. 

Our opponents are using the implicit bias of the refs to accentuate the penalties we are throwing, even when we aren't. I think this is where our opponents really shine. They are showing the refs exactly what the Preds are doing. There is no arguing that we are one of, if not THE most physical team on the ice right now. The refs know it and are look at our opponents to find those calls. Our opponents are helping them out by over-exaggerating silly stuff like taking a dive when a stick hits your skate. Looks like tripping if the ref is looking at the fall and not the skate/stick.   


How do we combat this? Well, my first thought was to engage with the Nashville SC to get some tips. All joking aside, though... what profession makes a living with seemingly real fighting? Professional wrestling. The Preds need to hire whoever trains these guys (Ask Seamus, he seems to really like us!) and get some acting lessons for our team. This isn't to fake penalties. I'm not condoning cheating. What this can do is change the perception of the team in the league and ref's eyes. If we can show that our opponent is being just as physical as we are, then we should see a reduction in BS calls made against us. We are throwing just as many penalties as our opponents, but the bias of the refs is preventing them from being objective about it. Turn the tables and show that the opponent is doing the same stuff we are and we can get back to playing real hockey. The kind where it's ok to fight every once in a while.   


The Preds are a tough team. Like, really gritty. They can take a hit. That's hurting us. It's ok to take the hit AND THEN go down to the ice. You get back up and shake it off. (Shake it off!) If it looks like the other team isn't hurting you, the refs will be conditioned to see that the penalties aren't there because it didn't impact your ability to keep playing. Act like it hurts and get some empathy from the refs and then take your power play and put pucks in nets.   


If anyone on the Preds reads this and thinks ""Wow, this dude has a point"" and wants me to take the post down so others don't come trolling for our strategy, DM me. I'm happy to do it, but you know, hook it up... I'm a size section 105 Row A in season tickets... or maybe just some glass seats to a few games for helping reduce the penalty mins. haha",mleyd001,2022-02-17 16:42:31

3126,454,llzv04,Should the Predators trade Pekka?,"Let me start with this...the idea of Pekka in anything other than a Predators sweater is disgusting to me, but if I am being unselfish for a second I will admit that I would love to see him win a Cup. Let's face it, Pekka is not going to win a cup in Nashville this year, and father time is working against Pekka. This season is not going to end with the Predators in the playoffs, so could we give Pekka a chance to win a cup and get an asset in return? Some of you will say there is no asset worth this, and that is absolutely a fair argument... which is why I asked this as a question.

What prompted this question is the Penguins are looking for a veteran goalie. Pekka Rinne, Devan Dubnyk, and Marc-Andre Fleury are all rumored to be their targets. For a deal to work with Nashville, Nashville would have to retain salary, and Pekka would have to approve of a deal because he has a modified no-move clause. So this isn't happening unless Pekka wants to do it.

Pekka is a free agent at the end of the season, so if we did trade him and he wanted to come back for another year, we could absolutely sign him to come back after this season is over. Ideally, after the expansion draft. So this would not necessarily mean the end of Pekka as a Predator. The question is does Pekka want to hang up his skates or not?

What could we get in return? Perhaps one of these players: 

* Samuel Poulin (Pittsburg's 2019 1st Round Pick) - Before the season, Poulin was said to be very close to being NHL ready. He has good size (6'2"") and is expected to be a good two-way forward. He plays LW and RW, and is expected to be a decent point producer. He was #97 on The Hockey Writer's Top 100 Prospects entering this season.
* Pierre-Oliver Joseph (Arizona's 2017 1st Round Pick)  - He is 21, 6'2"" and 185lbs. He is currently on their first pairing because of injury (so he is an NHL-ready defenseman), and he could potentially replace an aging Ekholm in the future... more importantly he could take ice time away from the penalty-prone Boroweicki immediately. Pittsburg is in win-now mode, so they may be willing to move him. I would love to even add Boroweicki as a sweetener if they would take him to fill the void this would create in their lineup.
* Kasperi Kapanen - He is only 24, and would be a good middle-six RW. He has 6 points in 11 games this year. He had 13 goals last year, and 20 goals the year before that. I would expect him to be around 20 goals per year in the future. 
* Jared McCann - Had 14 goals in 66 games last year, and he is only 24.",MusicCityJayhawk,2021-02-17 17:33:20

3136,464,i5nwah,"JoFA, Josi, Ellis, and Saros Appreciation Post","Like the title says, I'd like to thank Ryan Johansen, Filip Forsberg, Viktor Arvidsson, Roman Josi, Ryan Ellis, and Juuse Saros for showing up for the series and playing to their potential. Everyone else was as good as invisible aside from the occasional contribution (shout out to Matt ""$4M/point"" Duchene) and can take the bus back home. This team has been infuriating this year, and I think a lot of us (or at least me) had the hope that the players and coaches would make the most of the long pause to rest up, recollect themselves mentally, and heal from lingering injuries. As we've seen, most of the team didn't show up. Fucking embarassing. Special shout out to John Hynes for not making a single roster change when it was obvious we were playing with at best 1 and a half decent defensive pairings, and 2 lines (Shout out to Nick Bonino's line that one time in Game 2). Moves need to be made, and with the way they played I wouldn't be surprised if Arvy or Forsberg get moved in the offseason since they seem to be the only ones who produce on relatively team friendly deals and would net the best returns as much as I don't want to see them go. Fuck You, team except JoFA, 1st D Pairing, and Saros (and Rinne). Fuck you, John Hynes. Fuck you, David Poile for doing fucking nothing at the deadline and for mortgaging the future on an incomplete team. Fuck, time to eat some ice cream.

He was definitely given a lighter load (about 12 minutes) and easier defensive assignments, spending most of his time on the 3rd or 4th line. But he was on ice for both of our early goals and completely dominated the other lines defensively. Preds have an organizational problem. Not a Kyle Turris problem.

But as I take a step back and think about all the things that frustrated me: Ekholm's penalties, Subban's turnovers, Turris in general, that god awful powerplay... I dont think they are issues that aren't fixable. We had what I think many would consider a ""down"" year where 2 of our best players missed nearly a quarter of the season. Despite all of that, we won the division and set a new single season goal-record for Arvy. The team is undoubtedly talented. I think if you keep making this broad-sweeping changes it becomes harder to diagnose the problems during the offseason and implement some new changes. I don't want to see Subban gone, or Turris, or any other key player gone. I think we stay the course, take some time to dissect what exactly was wrong with the powerplay and focusing on improving with this group instead of scrapping it and moving to plan B.

3168,496,kqlx1y,Watching Askarov play has me worried.,"UPDATE AFTER THE BRONZE MEDAL GAME: I didn’t get to watch much of this game, but he looked better from what I saw! And I will say that him standing alone on the blue line was really impressive. I got a little worried, but I’m thrilled to see how he bounced back in the second half of yesterday’s game and today. And the maturity he displayed today makes me confident he’ll fix his issues and will be a star! Thanks for the great discussions!


I haven’t been able to watch much of the world juniors tournament this year, but I’m watching the Russia Canada game, and I’m worried that the Preds wasted their first round pick on Askarov. There are two really concerning things I’ve noticed just in this one game. First, he can’t hold onto his stick. He has dropped his stick at least 4 times in the first half of the game. Twice the Canadians scored while he didn’t have it. The second is how weak he is low on the glove side. He’s a tall goalie, but he keeps his glove really high, and the Canadians have score twice by putting the puck under his glove. I know these are fixable things, but I’m still confused by their choice to pick a goalie in the first round when we already have a solid line of goalies.

Edit. To be fair, he does look strong along the ice and can move really well, and he is going up against an all-star team of first-round draft picks. I really hope he pans out.

Edit. After the second half of the game, I’m a lot less worried. He proved he has a lot of potential. He has good movement and is good down low. I’m really hoping he pans out into an elite goalie. He definitely needs a lot of fundamental work, but  everything is fixable. I just hope he can learn to play well under the pressure of a big game like that was.",the_denouement,2021-01-05 00:17:47
3170,498,6ilmwk,I don't think Vegas takes Neal,"Or I don't think they keep him. Maybe they flip him.

If you read Mackenzie's Twitter tirade from this morning Vegas is taking on A LOT of salary in deals. I don't think they'll want to lock up another 5M in a one year deal. Fleury, Kruger and Clarkson to name a few. 

I think they avoid Neal. So then who?

Obviously the hope is Smith or Wilson and while slightly younger they aren't that much less expensive, unfortunately. They are probably both coming back.

Next that has had Chatter is Sissons. While he's had a fantastic playoff run i think it's still too early to tell if he's out kicked his coverage or if he's the real thing. I think they steer clear. 

I think they go for Aberg and sign him to a nice long term deal. He was projected to have a nice bit of a higher skill ceiling than Sissons and showed good spurts of it this year. 

I think for Vegas here's a guy they could try to lock up and put into a 2nd or 3rd like right away and for years to come.

Or they take Neal and send him elsewhere

From Friedman's 30 thoughts:

That leads to Nashville and Ottawa. The difficult thing for those clubs is that they left available a player other teams desire. One of the reasons Los Angeles eyed Evander Kane was that the Kings were intrigued by a player who needs a big year for a new, big contract. From what I’ve heard, talks with Buffalo have cooled. So, doesn’t James Neal fit that description? Predators GM David Poile indicated Tuesday he expects to lose a forward. He’s got some good young ones unprotected, but how much bite is Vegas getting on Neal? Los Angeles needs scoring, and they wouldn’t be the only ones.",KakunaUsedHarden,2017-06-21 12:55:33

Bonino, Smith, and Granlund were 2nd, 3rd, and 4th respectively on the team in goals scored in 2019-2020. I remember Bonino being a beast last year, but Smith and Granlund were much more productive than I remember them being.

According to CapFriendly, we only have 17 of 23 players signed at this moment. So this is nothing to be alarmed about. Poile has plenty of cap room to work with and open roster spots. Also, I suspect we will probably give up fewer goals as the newcomers are mostly known for being physical and good defensively.

I would expect Fabbro to increase from his 11 points from last year's rookie campaign. I also believe that Trenin (who is not listed on the roster at the moment) to increase his point production this year. Trenin had 6 points in 21 games. Assuming that there is no improvement, his production pace would be around 20 points by playing an 82 game schedule.  **Trenin scored 20 goals in 32 AHL games last year, compared to Tolvanen's 21 goals in 63 games.** Trenin is definitely my darkhorse pick for increased point production as it looks like he is going to get a lot more minutes this year, and hopefully will further develop.

Lastly, Ellis missed 20 games and Arvy missed about 10 games. Arvy was playing hurt for a lot of the year. If we can get full healthy seasons from both, that should make up some of the difference as well.",MusicCityJayhawk,2020-10-11 22:19:00

What's the best place to eat inside and out of the arena?  I know I've heard just walk up and down Broadway and there's plenty but looking for insight from fellow fans. 

I don't have my ticket yet but I'm wondering if there are any insights on how to avoid all the extras that go into buying a ticket from ""The Master""  Are there any local places I can look or groups that have a marketplace where unused tickets are sold?  Or are there people selling tickets out front?  What's my best bet to get in?  That being said if anyone isn't using a ticket for this game or be happy to take it off your hands of course 😉 

When getting my ticket what areas or sections are the ones to look for or avoid? 

Is there a place in The Stone or surrounding building I need to make sure to see our walk through?  This can be architecture, memorabilia,  plaques, anything cool and that makes the place unique?

What's the best way to get to the arena? I don't mind walking so should I just get dropped off on Broadway by an Uber?   I'm staying a few miles away kind of by the airport.

Any other advice is welcome also!  Thanks for the help!",Nerdybuffoon,2023-01-25 01:03:28

Last year we went on my actual bday, the 23rd, and I think we lost by 5 goals but we had great seats in the lower bowl and had a blast.  He lives in Alabama now so neither of us get to go often. 

Anywho, the title basically says it all.  Hoping to find a pair in the bowl priced reasonably.  Last year we scalped and paid I believe $75/per.  But we’re not cheapskates just looking for good seats.

3220,548,egmlz3,"My UAH curse, or Why I won’t be attending Preds games for a while","Let me start off with a quick caveat: I love this team. I’ve been watching them since I got interested in hockey in 2013. But every time I attend a Preds game, we lose in embarrassing fashion. And I think it might be my fault. 

See, I graduated from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. They have the only Division I college hockey program in the southeast and 1 of only 2 south of the Mason-Dixon. Before 2008, the UAH Chargers were good at hockey. But then their longtime coach retired and we have been completely terrible ever since. Yes, they’re the reason I got interested in hockey and  became a Preds fan. 

Unfortunately, since I have attended so many UAH games and watched the Chargers lose so many times, I may have brought some of their bad juju with me to Bridgestone Arena every time I drive up. Back in January, I got to watch the Preds get bombarded by the Jets. On Halloween, I watched us blow a 4-1 lead to the Flames. I was also in town on 12/14 against Dallas, and I just got home from tonight’s disaster against the Penguins. 

In short, because I am a UAH Fan and alumnus, I bring bad luck to the team every time I watch a game live. It has contributed to some of their worst losses in 2019. For that, I am sorry. I don’t think I will be attending many games in 2020. Maybe we won’t do as poorly if I stop attending games.",Strider755,2019-12-28 05:12:39

Weber and Irwin have proved that they deserve a spot and with Bitteo back we should have a serviceable 4-6 d. Our defense would not be what it was say two years ago but we have two guys in Fabbro and Girard who could make it on next years lineup but definitely make the lineup in two years.

3231,559,29qo6e,You must be Jokinen. [Rant],"2 days into the free agency and this is what we get? Another 30+ yr old forward?

Below is the quote from Poile on the signing:


> Olli Jokinen is a proven veteran center who will provide us with size, leadership and offensive ability in the tough Central Division and Western Conference,"" general manager David Poile said in a statement. ""He provides our coaching staff with more depth and options at the forward position and coach [Peter] Laviolette believes he is a good fit for our style of play.

Veteran? That's what Fish and Cullen are for. 

Offensive Ability? He had 43 points last year. That's pretty good but I thought this new era was aiming higher. 

Age? Oli is the second oldest person on the team at 35. Only Cullen is older(37).

I can't find the quote but Poile was mentioning that with the current depth chart, Oli may play wing. 

Wing? If you were looking for a veteran winger, why not Patrick Sharp?!?

That all being said, hopefully Oil works out or Poile brings in someone through trading to help out Neal.

Then free agency comes along with seemingly plenty of options, at least more than usual in my opinion. And crickets...

3246,574,5n61xg,Why did Lavy split up Josi/Subban and Ellis/Eks?,"Obviously we never really got to see Josi/Subban, but Ellis/Ekholm was such a fantastic pairing in our own zone and on offense. Good combination of size, speed, hockey IQ, shot power, and D positioning. While Ellis is still unbelievably good and Ekholm is still criminally underrated, I don't think either of them is playing to their potential like when they were paired.

I also don't understand splitting up Josi/Subban. We didn't split up Weber/Josi, so why not treat them the same and let them chew up the big minutes together? They're clearly 2 of our most talented skaters and 2 unbelievable offensive weapons. Subban has the size to make up for Josi's more slight frame, and they both are the perfect balance of aggressive/responsible. 

I talked about it with Crispy before one of the games I went to this season, and he wasn't sure. Obviously, the injury bug is making these pairings impossible, but in an ideal world where our whole roster was healthy, what's the rationale?",flirt77,2017-01-10 16:43:42

Also go blue.  Oh wait, there’s still cap space?  Grab Ondrej Palat and put him with RyJo, or at least try.

I’m aware that there’s an internal cap the Preds are operating off of but seriously, if you can grab any one of those three you’ve really added some real help.  If you get Laine that’s a scary first line, you get Copp or Palat that’s a really good second line and still a scary first line with Duchene and Forsberg.  You get Palat and Copp?

For anyone wondering why the NHL has a hard time promoting itself, lame ads like that could be Exhibit A. I've been watching hockey since I was in 4th grade, and I don't recognize some of those guys' faces. What's a casual fan, who might not recognize half the guys and might not know about the name-engraving tradition, going to think? When my wife first saw it, I had to explain it to her.  Someone flipping channels who's never watched hockey before is going to have no clue. The ad is head-scratching confusing for casual fans at best, and alienating at worst. A league struggling to compete with the NBA and everything else for ratings and attention spans doesn't need to be touting a history that only old farts in Toronto care about so much. Want to get people interested with an ad that's only got a few seconds to try to do it? Just give us cool highlights and shots of the crowd going wild.

3296,624,uwuk5s,"How to ""blow it up"" to rebuild","This will not happen - Poile has made it clear he will add to this team and attempt to get back into the playoffs. It's worth pointing out that I don't want this to happen. However, if we had to, here is how I would ""blow up"" this team in order to maximize future return through acquiring picks and prospects plus deliberately tanking for the next 2-3 seasons. 

The ultimate goal is to: acquire as many picks as possible unless a Grade A prospect is available, give young players as much ice time as possible, and generally be terrible. The aim is to be a playoff team in 3 seasons and a Stanley Cup winning team in 5-7 seasons. 

To fill roster holes I can only use players who are currently in Milwaukee: Askarov, Ingram, Glass, Afanasyev, Farrance, Myers. Or bring in cap dump players to acquire picks. 

**Overview:**  
Currently the Preds have $25,887,191 in cap space for 2022-2023 season. We are currently below the cap floor and need to spend at least $60m.  
The Preds have one 1st round pick and two 3rd round picks. We do not have any second round picks.  

**OUT:**   
Forsberg - he does not fit the plan of a rebuilding team as he is too old and wants too much money. The focus is on youth.  
Joey - Retain $4m of his contract in order to increase value. Worth at least a first.  
Ingram - He can get a great return to a cap-crunched team who needs a solid back up. Should be a solid prospect in return plus a high end pick. Askarov is in the wings so we don't need a long term solution at the moment.   
All free agents not on RFAs: Grimaldi, Cousins, Benning, Harpur, Rittich. Plus Luff.   

**IN:**  
Cody Glass - takes Joey's spot on the 2nd line.  
Myers - has a spot as our bottom pair D.  
Afanasyev - gets a trial run but spends the year in the AHL.  
Mike Hoffman - cap dump from Montreal. 33 year old winger on a $4.5m/year deal. Last year Hoffman scored 15 goals in 67 games.  
TJ Oshie - Cap dump from Washington. 35 year old winger on a $5.75m deal for another 3 years. Last year he potted 11 goals in 44 games!  
A couple of Cousin's level grinders on cheap deals who are 4th line / healthy scratched. 

**Re-signed:**
Anyone with a RFA tag: Glass, Kunin, Trenin, Lauzon. Even if you don't like them, they're young and under team control and get another year as a trial run. 


Our new team: 

Tolvanen - Granlund - Duchene  
Tomasino - Glass - Hoffman   
Trenin - Sissons - Jeannot  
Oshie  - McCarron - Kunin

Josi - Fabbro  
Ekholm - Carrier  
Myer - Lauzon  
Boro  

Saros  
Back up  

There is it! A team that straddles the cap floor and is built to lose. Obviously this is not the direction of the team but I imagine this is what it would look like if we did move forward.",Unknown,2022-05-24 16:17:28

We beat CBJ twice, Chicago twice, and split the series with Florida. I think we would have split the series with Carolina had we played both games.

If we can sweep Detroit this week I will be ok with where we are. We're beating the teams we should beat and losing games we should lose.

3308,636,c7s233,"If Duchene signs, should we trade Turris?","Turris was hurt during most of the 18-19 season. He played well at worlds for team Canada, and considering how crazy the country is about hockey,  I am sure that everyone in Canada knows that he looked better. His stock is higher now than it was at the end of the year.

&#x200B;

Do you try to trade Turris now, or do you expect him to rebound in the coming year and trade him in the future? He is probably not going to get a lot of points with 3rd line wings. But I gotta think that the following forward depth chart would be pretty stacked:

&#x200B;

Forsberg - Johansen - Arvidson

Grimaldi/Boyle - Duchene - Granlund

Grimaldi/Boyle - Turris - Smith

Pitlick/Watson - Bonino - Sissons

&#x200B;

Jarnkrok could fill in anywhere there was an injury. 

&#x200B;

If we trade Turris, Bonino is on the third line, and Jarnkrok/Sissons is on the fourth?

&#x200B;

Quick side note, with Grimaldi's playoff performance, I hope he gets more time on the 2nd line. He showed glimpses of something special all year while on the 4th line. I wonder if he would have been a lot more productive if paired with a top 2 center.",MusicCityJayhawk,2019-07-01 12:37:53

3310,638,4j7uxa,Is it time to move on from David Poile?,"David Poile has been an NHL GM for 33 years. In that time, his teams have generally had good regular seasons, regular playoff appearances, and then can't get anywhere once in the playoffs. In his 33 years, only once has his team gotten to the third round, and in that year, his team was swept. So his teams have never won a third round game. In 33 years.

The capitals from the 80s to mid 90s were a carbon copy of this Preds franchise. Good defenseman, Popular but occasionally inconsistent Goaltenders, and offense by committee. The capitals were consistently good regular season, and then melted in the playoffs. Most of the time, entire playoff games would go by where it looked like one giant power play for the opponent -the entire game would be in the Capital defensive zone. Any of this sounding familiar?

Poile is very much what Nashville has been familiar with. Jeff Fisher, Keving Stallings, Barry Trotz - none of them were awful, they were fairly consistent, and you weren't going to bottom out. But you knew you were never going to win a championship with those guys.

If you're fine being a ""good team on a limited budget"", if you accept first or second round exits in exchange for being a playoff team most years, then Poile's our guy. Some of you very well might accept that.

If you ever want to see the Stanley Cup in Smashville, it's time to move on. History is clear, and 33 years is plenty of time for us to know - David Poile is exactly who he is going to be.",blueyb,2016-05-13 19:04:45

Not to mention it only being a five hour drive. Game is February 22nd, how does that time of year tend to be in terms of weather? I looked it up and it looks like average temp is 52, with ~8 days with rain in February.

I've begun looking for tickets, just two, and wanted to reach out to see what the best venue is for buying, as well as opinions on good seating locations. I tend to favor the lower bowl corners, about midway up or so at Nationwide.

In terms of shoot twice versus shoot once, I'm open to whatever, although being on the side the visitor bench is would be beneficial for going down for warm ups (is that a thing there? How early before a game do doors open?). I had looked at like 103, 103, 118, 119, perhaps about row P?

Furthermore, are there any recommendations on hotels (decent - definitely no need for 5 star but..) that aren't terribly far walking distance yet fairly reasonably priced? I can't recall how close Bridgestone is to the strip with bars etc (also would we get ate alive wearing BJs jerseys?) or if there's must visit places near by in terms of a hockey bar or anything?

Thanks in advance for any and all advice! FYI, in terms of other teams in the league, the Preds are definitely up there in terms of who I like. In the west I tend to pull for you guys for sure. Couple of players I really like watching including Arvdy, and Dutchy. If Rinne has a solid year and the power play gets on track, I'd think you would be in a position to really make a run.",ZEBuckeye81,2019-09-10 17:45:12

3389,717,2onkdq,A Chicago fan rant.,"I've been to my fair share of games against Chicago over the past few seasons, and every time the story is always how annoying their fans are. I gave myself a couple days after the game to actually hash out my thoughts on this whole thing, so here goes... Can we stop the incessant complaining about this?

I couldn't attend Saturday's game due to other circumstances. When I came to Reddit to get a recap of the game (I prefer the fan reactions over the milquetoast blogger and newspaper recaps), all I saw were ""Chicago fans suck and they are terrible and yada yada"" posts everywhere. I seriously could not find a good synopsis of the game anywhere on /r/Predators that was worth a damn.

In my opinion, if you want to deal with the obnoxious members of the /r/Blackhawks community, here's my recommendation: ignore them. Ignore them on /r/hockey, ignore them here, ignore them on the GDTs. Stop adding fuel to the fire by complaining about them cheering during the anthem, their trolling, and their comments about calling us stupid. Yes, I know how we Preds fans take the comments about us being a dumb, Southern, ""never-gonna-be-a-hockey-city"" fanbase very personally, but don't take the bait. It's not worth it.

If them taking over Bridgestone Arena bothers you? Help get the word out to sell those tickets earlier in the season. They purchase them shortly after single-game sales start and plan a vacation around it. Convince your STH friends to not sell their tickets to Hawks fans even if it'll make them a 3000% profit. If we don't get the word out, we can't and won't sell the tickets to Preds fans for those games because they'll be swept up quickly by the red flood.

Anywho, that's my rant. Yes, Hawks fans annoy the crap out of me, but complaining about them isn't going to make it any better.

tl;dr: Ignore the Hawks fans instead of complaining about them so much.",motherfuckintrex,2014-12-08 15:53:50

Dallas converted EIGHT of their twelve power play opportunities in this dumpster fire of a series. Absolutely unacceptable. 

I will absolutely admit that it's probably still too early to judge the team's performance and Hynes' coaching job. We just don't have that big of a sample size yet. But how much time are you willing to give him? Personally, I'm not at all confident that he's the guy to right this ship, but I am more than ready to be proven wrong.

3439,767,ok9650,I'm trying to learn more about each team's players (Year 4),"Hey Predators Fans!

I wanted to take this time are continue my research and compile this year’s list of player analyses. This is my 4th year going to each team’s sub and asking for the commenters to post their analysis on each player on your favorite team. Then I’ll compile all the posts into one master post, and post that on r/hockey. The point of this project is so every fan has access to updated information on each player, and if someone wants to learn about a specific player they can easily click a few links to read up on that player.

Here are the lists from the past two years on your guys’ analyses on your team’s players:

[2020 Player Analyses]( https://old.reddit.com/r/Predators/comments/gz2w9s/im_trying_to_learn_more_about_each_teams_players/)

[2019 Player Analyses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Predators/comments/c3cr5x/im_trying_to_learn_more_about_each_teams_players/)

[2018 Player Analyses]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Predators/comments/8hrqva/im_trying_to_learn_more_about_each_teams/)

And here are the master posts from these seasons that includes a link to each team’s posts:

[2020 Master Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/h89kwr/i_recently_visited_each_teams_subreddit_asking/)

[2019 Master Post]( https://old.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/cb3btn/i_recently_visited_each_teams_subreddit_asking/)

[2018 Master Post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8ias47/i_recently_visited_each_teams_subreddit_asking/)

I (and hopefully others) found this to be a useful resource to quickly learn about any player on any team.
This time I will ask for a similar analysis, for all skaters and goalies that were on your team’s roster for the 2020-2021 season. How would you rank your team’s forwards, your defensemen and your goalies? A short blurb on each would be very helpful (for example, what are the strengths and weaknesses of this player? What career projection do you hold for this player?

Thanks a lot!",Swaggyoloh,2021-07-14 17:27:08

All this talk of “being in on Hall” has me looking for UFAs fitting the younger, re-tool mindset. Just looking for some discussion.

Edit: Duclair elected to represent himself, opting out of Ottawa’s “premium” deal. GMs are also going to leverage the lack of funding to pitch mid-tier FAs short term, inexpensive deals. Once he shops around as his own agent, he may realize that teams aren’t going to be willing or able to pay him what he wants. 

Regardless of Duclair’s uptick last year, I see the two caveats just mentioned keeping his value within range.",SeductiveHobo,2020-10-08 15:25:27

-Pekka Rinne is so much fun to watch. Such an elite goaltender who is athletic and has a unique form. Love watching his great saves and love watching players get frustrated playing against him.

-Kyle Turris...I've been a jerk about his play. Granted, he had a rough year (a few guys did) but you know something? He never stopped hustling and working his ass off. Just couldn't get things to click. But when he got bumped down he'd shoot right back up. Still tried to do everything right. It just didn't work. Ideally we want him to produce up to his pay grade, but we gotta credit him for the fact that he was very much trying to earn his check. I think a lot of other players his age and in his position would have just gone through the motions until the offseason. He didn't.

-We expected this team to go further and we know they have the potential to go further. But hey, how awesome that we have this great and entertaining team where we can actually have those kinds of expectations!",Birdhawk,2019-04-23 16:15:11

Next to some of them our stuff looks tired and half assed.  I like the video that's cool but maybe before the real pregame entrance starts.  Everything after that needs an upgrade.

People say that he brings physicality and fighting to the team. If he was so good at physical play, he wouldn't have such horrendous shot suppression stats. And fighting does absolutely nothing to win games. It doesn't change them. It doesn't make more goals or more shots or stop goals against us. There is absolutely no reason a pylon should be in the league, starting over way more talented players who deserve a roster spot. It’s a complete affront to Rocco and other deserving players who are scratched or are in the AHL. If he is such a great locker room presence, then have him in the locker room and not on the ice for 7 minutes, tiring out the rest of the team who have to fill in the rest of the time he’s not on the ice.

Edit: McLeod had 2:12 of ice time today.",fartsniffer87,2019-02-10 18:36:47

3526,854,onp69y,Thoughts on the protection list.,"Something that has been bothering me about our protection list, and I wanted to think about it before posting: 

I've been trying to wrap my head around the fact that the Preds protected Jeannot & Myers over Jarnkrock and Sissons. I feel like the Ellis trade makes sense to a degree, but the timing feels really off. If you are dead set on trading him, why not wait until after the deadline? Arguably you could get more for him after the draft when the league opens back up. Glass and Myers are unknowns at best right now. 

Jeannot is a real head scratcher to me. Dont get me wrong I love the guy, its a great story, but he is a 4th line replacement player. He was in the roster for only 15 games and that was enough to protect him over Jarnkrock or Sissons?

I feel like everytime those teams enter the zone with speed, I expect them to score. But with the preds, I feel like we just try to keep the puck in the zone and pass it around the perimeter instead of trying to score. It also feels like every pred just expects the other guys on the ice to make something happen on offense and the PP, which leads to nothing happening except pump fake one timers .

Who will be there to take his place

And maybe, he'll find out

A way to make it back someday

To help you, impress you, and bring a smile to your face

I know the locker room is probably not perfect and there's likely issues that are seen across the league but at least right now it's looked really good on our end recently.",1047293856,2021-07-24 05:05:11
3562,890,113ahmz,Tankaton Watch,"Tired of watching this dump and chase team lethargically limp towards missing the playoffs? Here is your guide to reveling in our collapse: the TANKATHON WATCH.

The Preds currently sit in the 15th overall draft spot. But we can do better! While the quest for Bedard is all but over for this team, a first line quality player is in the cards. 
Bedard is billed as an elite, generational talent on pace or potentially better than McDavid. But players as low as 4th overall are being projected as NHL All-Star talent. Even the 10th overall pick is projected as a top of the line up / high-end 2nd line player. 

The top 7 spots are pretty locked in at this point but if the Preds try hard they can end up with as high as a Top 8 pick. But how do they do it? 

**1) Lose, you assholes.** The Preds need to start losing games ASAP. The Preds currently on are pace to get 1.098 points per game (BAD!) - for an estimated total of 90 points. If we project out every team's point per game pace over 82 games, the Preds will need to be under 80 points this season in order to get 8th over all. Which means they can only get .75 points per game from here on out. 

**2) Win, you assholes.** Alternatively, the Preds also need other teams to start winning games. Here is who we are competing with: Philly, St. Louis, Ottawa, Florida, Islanders, Det, and Buffalo. 

Philly - Torts already committed to a rebuild (BAD!).  
St. Louis - Seem to have committed to a rebuild by trading Tarasenko (BAD!).  
Ottawa - After trading for DeBrincat this off season, they are probably still going for it (GOOD!).  
Florida - They do not own their draft pick and have no reason to tank (GOOD!).  
Islanders - Just spent big money on Horvat. Will not tank (GOOD!). 
Detroit, Buffalo - Probably too good, should end up more in the middle (HOPEFUL!).  

In my mind, with just a bit of a push towards the bottom, the Preds can easily get a 10th overall pick and a glimmer of a chance for a cheeky Bettman lottery win. This is THE draft to compete in and the Preds can't let the pride of the playoffs get in the way of our long term success.",Unknown,2023-02-15 22:29:33

3582,910,i5tdvj,Offseason thoughts,"I’ve refrained from posting or commenting on here for the series to let everyone get the shit posting out of their systems. Here’s some thoughts on the offseason and beyond:

I’m not sold on Hynes as coach but I’m not ready to give up on him. He came in half way thorough the season to a team. Give him a full year and see what he can do. I have made been vocal on my views that Karl Taylor in no way should be head coach. But, I do think he should be brought up as an assistant to give him some experience in the NHL. 

The biggest issue this team has had all year and especially this series is playing a full 60 minutes. All three losses to Arizona can be boiled down to that. Not to say there aren’t some other thing to work on but that is the biggest problem. 

Saros has cemented himself as the number one goalie and Pekka is still good for about 20-25 starts which is a good situation to have. One of the only teams that could have as favorable of a goaltending situation next year is whoever convinces the Rangers to trade them Lundqvist. The big question for me on the defensive side is who plays on the third pair next season. Hamhuis isn’t getting resigned and Weber is probably gone as well. Tinordi played well to earn a spot but who pairs with him. Carrier is going to be the hot pick but we could find a cheap veteran if he’s shaky. 

One of Granlund or Smith is surely gone and maybe both. Skill wise I think Granlund should be signed but financially and sentimentally Smith is the guy. Turris will undoubtedly be shopped along with whichever previously mentioned player doesn’t get signed. I know a lot of people are really high on Tomasino making the team this year but I’m in the belief that unless he is head and shoulders above every one except Forsberg, Duchene and Arvidsson he should go back to the OHL for another year for development. 

If we somehow by the grace of the hockey gods win the lottery on Monday, if I’m Poile I’m offering Tolvanen and our second round pick for a middle first round pick and a third rounder. 

On the undiscussed topic of uniforms: the Preds should keep the Winter Classics as alternates and have the checkerboard ones as throwbacks that the league is rumored to be doing for all teams. Then in two years make a gold version of the WC jerseys and those be our home and away set. 

Hate to see my team bounce out early but excited to watch some good hockey coming up. Ready for next season if it’s a couple months away or a year away. Go Preds.",Beatse21,2020-08-08 05:01:24

3585,913,eva81u,Last night's game....,"I think I am a bad luck charm this year and have elected to stay home for the rest of the season. I drive an hour away for Preds games. I was extremely excited to see the team play for a 4th time this year. After the 3rd period I should have stayed home. I have been to 4 games this season and we are 1-3 in those games. I saw us beat the Sharks, lose to Flames after being up 3 goals, The Winter Classic (great experience, terrible hockey), and last night's game. 

I was mad about our defense the whole game. We couldn't get the puck out of the defensive zone, we forgot how to pass, we forgot how to skate, and our powerplay is dead awful. We just aren't even a cohesive team right now. Nobody is on the same page as their teammates. Joey looks lost every shift. The only 4 skaters I saw give their all was Josi, Forsberg, Arvi, and Rocco. Pekka made some great saves, but our defense literally just let players skate by with zero resistance. We heard the same bull crap answers after game. ""We have to be more competitive, we can't only show up for 5 minutes."" 

I'm so done with the team's attitude this year. We are not making the playoffs, it's just not happening. I hate it because Bridgestone during the playoffs is wonderful. That's another thing, how did we go from being one of the best home teams to one of the worst. 

I understand I am beating a dead horse at this point but as a fan it's so sad to see us nosedive so fast.",Unknown,2020-01-28 19:30:13

3607,935,om56of,My mock offseason,"I thought it would be fun to take a stab at what I would do for the rest of the offseason: 
<br> 

- Trade Ellis to Philadelphia for Morgan Frost and the 14th pick. 
- Protect 4F/4D (Forsberg, Kunin, Sissons, Trenin, Josi, Ekholm, Carrier, and Fabbro) 
- Seattle takes Jarnkrok. I would offer a 2nd next year for them to take the Duchene or Joey contracts but I don’t think that would do it. 
- Trade 14th and 18th pick to Detroit for the 6th pick. Detroit wants a goalie but 6th is too high for them. Nashville selects LW/C William Eklund. Target BPA Dmen with our 2nds. 
- Resign Granlund and Haula while looking at FA for 3rd line D and backup goalie. 
<br> 
I think it’s going to be impossible to get out of the Duchene and Joey contracts right now without paying a ransom. I think you bring them back hoping the roster shakeup around them with push them. With the moves in this exercise, it allows the preds to compete for the playoffs while infusing a lot of talent in the prospect pool with Eklund, Frost, and Tomasino on his way up. At the deadline, if we are competing, resign Ekholm to a reasonable contract like 3/4years $4m-ish and hope Forsberg resigns. If we are not competing, I’d trade both at the deadline and continue infusing talent into the roster.

3635,963,exwjt5,Trade Deadline,"With the trade deadline coming up, realistically who do you see being moved (if anyone) and what kind of return do you think there would be? It’s quickly getting to that point in the season where unless a massive win streak happens, the Preds are on the outside looking in. Would much rather them try to get something for some of the pending FAs than just letting them walk or trading their rights for peanuts at the draft.",RootBeerFloat84,2020-02-02 22:29:38
3636,964,c2wp6z,$10 Prospect Game,"Unbelievable.  June 29th, and season ticket holders get ""exclusive"" access to *purchase* $10 tickets.  I'm stunned that this isn't even free for loyal legion.  And it's all the way in Antioch at the ice center.  The cash grab has gotten ridiculous that a friggin future stars prospect game isn't even a perk anymore.

$10 for hard bench seating half rink viewing, at best, more likely 3 deep standing room.  No frickin thanks.  I'm honestly stunned and very disappointed as this is an annual summer event I usually look forward to.",ns10fan,2019-06-20 14:29:19
3637,965,ahc8jj,Change my mind,"We need beef. Big net front presence beef. 

I love Watty, but he can’t do this job alone. We need a guy who has some skill and can dole out some punishment. I think we should try for the Wayne Train. 

My ideal situation would be moving Fiala to the 3rd line and slotting Wayne in with Turris and Smith. 

I know Poile hates the idea of rentals, but I feel like we have to add a big physical guy with some skill to really make this playoff push. Not to mention add a much needed boost to our joke of a power play.

I’m not a numbers guy, so I’m unsure of what it would take to get him here, but assuming we could pull it off while retaining our current roster (and Tolvanen and Fabbro), I say it’s the move we should make. ",TUGJOYS_BASTARDWASH,2019-01-18 16:35:19

3641,969,an2nxe,Preds Lose Starter Pack,"Preds lose? Power play still anemic? Ready to voice your rage in a Post Game Thread but don't know how to say what you want to say? Good news! I scoured through old threads to find common reactions to all of our Predators woes. Next time we lose - you'll know where to look first! 

**The Power Play:** 

-Start a new thread about the power play. In the comments you can add in:  
	“We need to try harder!!!”  
	“When is something going to be done about this?”  
	“Something has to change”

""Fire the power play coach"" - (No matter what - don’t mention his name).

""I'm starting to lose respect for Lavi.""

**Time for a trade:**

“We DEFINITELY need a trade”

“This is inexcusable. We need to trade for (insert another team’s franchise player on an $9m over 8 year deal). GMDP can get it done! Maybe a (shitty prospect) and (2nd or lower draft pick)???”

“I think *Forsberg / Arvy / Saros* played great. Everyone else should be let go! When is X going to start justifying his salary?""

“It’s time to let Pekka go to a team who has a chance of winning a cup.” *(No shit this one is real)*

**Grab Bag**

“Embarrassing” 

""I paid $XXX to go to this game. How could the Preds do this to me?""


**Predicting the future:**

“How are we ever going to beat *Jets / Wild / Dallas / Tampa / Toronto* in the second round?""

“We won’t make it out of the first/second round like this.”

**Fiala done fucked up again** (for you u/VolsPE)

""Fiala and a second for Simmonds???""

""Trade Fiala... we have an identical player in Tolvanen in the system with even more upside.""

""Not gonna lie I always kinda thought that fiala would be a bit of a douche off ice""

**Sure…blame the black guy:**

“I’m just not a fan of PK.”

**And my personal favorite:**

""I'm just here to overreact.""",Unknown,2019-02-04 15:23:30

I just moved to the state of Tennessee from a place with no hockey allegiance, so I am jumping ship and hitching up with you guys. I come from the devils so I am familiar with Hynes and I think you guys have Santini too. 

Anyway, I would appreciate it if you guys could learn me up on some memes, break out players (grimaldi?), who are the prospects/is the pool good or are the cupboards bare? Who are the biggest rivals? Etc.

I am bummed that the season is postponed. I was stoked to finally go see a game  but I guess I'll have to wait, and in the mean time learn about the team and get hyped for getting started again.

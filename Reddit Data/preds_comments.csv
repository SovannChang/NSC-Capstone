4,dhxba2m,dhx2idl,"As a Wings fan whose parents live close to Nashville, I love going to Bridgestone Arena because the tickets are way more affordable than at the Joe and I can bring them along too!

However, the Preds are my second team, and I really hope you take your first cup. I also wish Sharks took their first cup last year. ",Joshkl2013,2017-05-23 10:34:53,6cs0jf
5,dhxih36,dhxba2m,"Nashville born and raised, and DET is still my #2 team. Despite the rivalry at one time, DET was pretty instrumental in getting hockey established here in Nashville. I feel like a lot of old Preds fans were Wings fans at one point, but they moved on. The Wings were my family's team until Nashville finally got one, then we jumped ships like no tomorrow.

It's amazing. Having grown with this franchise, all the firsts. It's like watching your kid grow up and watching them succeed through all of their hardships and obstacles. I am euphoric. It's a special feeling and it's special to see how the city is responding. No matter what happens in the Finals we have won a lot from this season. I couldn't be any more proud.

13,dhx2dsc,dhx0enw,"They have three star forwards, Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry and Ryan Kesler who are all supremely skilled, but are known to play a less than clean game. 

Perry in particular is sort of famed for the stupid shit he pulls, while being a star player. Kesler too is known as a real pest to play against. 

In addition, they won their previous series against the Edmonton Oilers on a controversial call, and as such, essentially the entirety of Western Canada now actively roots against them.

So, some of the hate is deserved, some is via the roulette table that is video review in the NHL, and some is good old fashioned rivalry. ",Haringoth,2017-05-23 04:25:05,6cs0jf

46,dhxsgbv,dhxqyur,It's a little difficult to explain. First there is a general sports rivalry between the bay area and LA area. So while there is a rivalry between the Sharks and Ducks at least partly out of principle due to geography there is also a mutual respect between the two fanbases due to their mutual hatred of Kings.

234,dgjwigr,dgjqay6,"Andrew Berkshire over at Sportsnet did as well... and has actually been tooting the Preds horn for awhile.  I think he knew all along that a) injuries and b) getting guys into the right lines was what was keeping the Preds from looking like the elite team they really were.  He also, REALLY INTELLIGENTLY, points out that the Preds lose in the NHL's ""tie breaker mini-games"" - 3-on-3 and shootouts - but seem to dominate the point of the game... playing 5-on-5 hockey.  Shockingly, there are no tie breakers in the playoffs.  You play hockey until you're done playing hockey.  Ya know... it's almost as if Coach Laviolette knew that and coached to that.

Everything, and I mean everything, fell into place a week and a half or two weeks before the playoffs.  Factor in that Playoff Pekka seems to be a different human being than Regular Season Pekka and it's hard for people to think that the Preds were going to upset the Hawks.

Even accounting for ALL of those things, the Hawks that the Preds just beat were not the team people were expecting.  Partly the Preds made them look slow, and partly they were actually slow.

The Predators team of the last 9 days has made it hard to predict anything.  I think if you made my fill out a bracket now, I'd have no better information than I did 2 weeks ago... except that the Preds beat the Hawks.  Something drastic has happened with the Predators and the rest of the playoffs ride on that change lasting.",kithoo,2017-04-21 07:22:31,66mkai

276,dgjusjm,dgjo18m,How are we looking against the Blues? Haven't watched any of their games ,august_west_,2017-04-21 06:07:56,66mkai
277,dgjw9ns,dgjusjm,"If the Preds play the next 2 series like they played the previous one, they deserve the Cup, regardless of opponent.  There are few teams in the NHL (and I've watched 70ish% of the playoffs) that look as strong bell to bell as the Predators have in the last two weeks.

The Blues, specifically, are a hard team to quantify right now.  They're good, they're (pretty) big, and they're faster than the Hawks.  They're also playing against a Minnesota team that nearly fell off the rails at the end of the season and have dropped one game to them.  If the Blues wrap it up in 5 (which is likely), it will be a hard fought series either way.  If Minnesota grinds the Blues out to 7, they will be tired and the Preds will look as fresh as they did the last 4 games.

Right now, today, I'd take the Preds in 5 or 6 against the Blues, but if you'd asked me that 3 weeks ago, I had the Hawks over the Preds 4-2.... and I'm a season ticket holder.  It's really hard to quantify how fundamentally better the Preds looked in this series than at any other point in the season, really.  No one expected a) the Hawks to look that bad and b) the Preds to look that good.

EDIT : If Pekka continues a .950+ sv%, it may not matter at all.",kithoo,2017-04-21 07:11:08,66mkai

279,dgkj0mm,dgjx6rw,"Agreed, but that's the X factor.  Are the Preds going to continue to play this hard?  Where was this team all season?  Yes, injuries and coming together and lines definitely played a part in a roller-coaster season where, at points, making the playoffs became questionable...

But, yes, if the Preds stay on at this pace and the Blue stay on at their pace, the Preds are assuredly the better team.",kithoo,2017-04-21 17:49:49,66mkai
280,dgk8hhd,dgjw9ns,I really have no idea if the hawks were really just slow/bad or we just made them look that way. Like do y'all think the hawks would have been eliminated by anyone else?,bigtuck54,2017-04-21 14:30:29,66mkai
281,dgkjbni,dgk8hhd,"A little of column A and little of column B.  The Hawks came in complacent because they expected the same Preds they beat 4 out of 5 in the regular season.  What they got was entirely different.  The Jofa line was unstoppable, Sissons came out as one of the fastest guys on the ice.  Our top 4 defensemen proved what was already on paper - they are the best top 4 D in the NHL bar none.  There may be better single defensemen (Karrsson is some sort of wizard), but they're just one man - we have 4.  Playoff Pekka, as has been said many times, came to win.

So would another team have beaten the Hawks?  Maybe, but that would have required the Hawks to be as complacent about them as they were about the Preds and I'm not sure that would have been the case.  This was, as many things in sports are, the perfect alignment.  The Hawks came in tired, clearly un-practiced, and unprepared for the Predators.  The Predators came in hungrier than I have seen a professional sports team that isn't the Spurs.  You could tell by the play, by the players' faces, and by the coaching this team wanted to prove something.  They wanted to show that every single pundit that picked the Hawks (which was something like 95% of them) wasn't paying attention.",kithoo,2017-04-21 17:55:38,66mkai

I'm a hawks fan and I'm worried about solving Rinne. The hawks are outmatched right now but you can never count them out. Complacency changes things too.

I'm a fan of that Tomasino-Novak-Evangelista line as a secondary scoring line but I'd be surprised to see Nyquist lower than the second line which worries me a bit, cos I think Tomasino and Evangelista both need regular top 6 minutes to prove themselves this season. If it is a third line of say Nyquist-Glass-Fagemo that's not to be sniffed at though. I guess either way you end up with two players who should be top 6 on the third line.",TheOriginalJez,2023-10-08 09:02:36,172qpfd

Yah it’s hard to break up that Novak line. Looking at the preseason numbers, that has been our most threatening line. Evangelista and Sherwood have swapped some and you lose that scoring threat but gain aggressive forchecking but shots are still flying. In that case, he was moved up to the RoR line or Sissons line with Trenin. Feels like an arrow in the quiver if you will.",KaleidoscopeOk1346,2023-10-08 10:54:08,172qpfd

----

All this should be qualified with: fans expectations of lines are always WAY different than what an actual NHL team runs. We hated Hynes' ""line blender"" but that's truly how most NHL teams operate. You usually have your starting lines numbered 1 through 4, and those will get random ice time depending on how they're deployed.  And then those lines get mixed around mid-game too. It's just how it works. 

For example, I picked a random game - Boston vs. Florida game 2 of their 7 game playoff series. These are the lines per Natural Stat Trick: https://imgur.com/a/nufrbjy

Even on a President's Trophy winning team, with a great coach, there's still about 10 different line combos that played that game.",GMBarryTrotz,2023-10-09 14:15:27,172qpfd

Fagemo basically takes that role. The other botttom of the roster forwards (McCarron, Sherwood, Smith) all do something useful better than Gurianov. McC can play Center, Smith is a better grinder, Sherwood has more offensive pop.

The Preds didn’t really do anything outstanding but they held their own and were in it for 55 minutes or so. They got pinned in their zone a lot in the first. The second was a lot better. They just got the one goal, though.

I thought Lankinen was the best Pred and Trenin had a good game. I thought the defensive structure held up for the most part against the Canes, who are pretty scary when their D can activate in the o-zone. They did but didn’t get much until the end.

If the true goal is for the team to keep tightening up the new systems, they got some more ice time against a quality opponent. It wasn’t great by any means but for most of the game, they were okay.",evanwilliams212,2023-10-07 08:43:04,171twgw

They've been kinda stuck in the middle of the pack for years. Not really good enough for meaningful success, but also not bad enough to get the draft lottery and score some really high-calibre young talent. They're maybe the best example in modern hockey of a defensive powerhouse though, which is interesting. Teams that can usually put in 5 or 6 goals a game struggle to get more than a couple against the Preds. If they can put together an offense to compliment that they could easily become a legitimate threat.

All this should be qualified with: fans expectations of lines are always WAY different than what an actual NHL team runs. We hated Hynes' ""line blender"" but that's truly how most NHL teams operate. You usually have your starting lines numbered 1 through 4, and those will get random ice time depending on how they're deployed.  And then those lines get mixed around mid-game too. It's just how it works. 

For example, I picked a random game - Boston vs. Florida game 2 of their 7 game playoff series. These are the lines per Natural Stat Trick: https://imgur.com/a/nufrbjy

They've been kinda stuck in the middle of the pack for years.

They're maybe the best example in modern hockey of a defensive powerhouse though, which is interesting. Teams that can usually put in 5 or 6 goals a game struggle to get more than a couple against the Preds. If they can put together an offense to compliment that they could easily become a legitimate threat.

It's just how it works. 

For example, I picked a random game - Boston vs. Florida game 2 of their 7 game playoff series. These are the lines per Natural Stat Trick: https://imgur.com/a/nufrbjy

Even on a President's Trophy winning team, with a great coach, there's still about 10 different line combos that played that game.",GMBarryTrotz,2023-10-09 14:15:27,172qpfd

They've been kinda stuck in the middle of the pack for years. Not really good enough for meaningful success, but also not bad enough to get the draft lottery and score some really high-calibre young talent. They're maybe the best example in modern hockey of a defensive powerhouse though, which is interesting. Teams that can usually put in 5 or 6 goals a game struggle to get more than a couple against the Preds. If they can put together an offense to compliment that they could easily become a legitimate threat.

9:35 A penalty each way (Lauzon and ZAR roughing on each other). We are now four on four, set to expire at 11:35.

9:53 Penalty to Coughlan. Nashville now has a 4-on-3.

10:59 Penalty to Shore. This **DOES NOT** change Nashville’s playing strength (that rule ***ONLY*** applies to 3-on-3 overtime play, **never** in regulation); the Predators are still entitled to four skaters only. Since a team can never be short three players, Shore’s penalty does not yet start (although he is required to report to the box). Play is still 4-on-3.

11:35 The first two penalties expire. Nashville is now entitled to go to 5 skaters with the release of Lauzon. For Carolina, Shore’s penalty time starts to run; ZAR’s time is up, but he still can’t leave (the same principle that applies at the end of a 10-minute misconduct).

11:39 Stoppage. This automatically lets ZAR out, regardless of why the play was stopped. Carolina is still serving two penalties, with 14 seconds left on Coughlan’s penalty and 1:56 on Shore’s. Thus, play would now be 5-on-3 to Nashville, but… Nashville has committed a too-much-man penalty at some point, and Evangelista is selected to serve it. There are now two penalties on the board for the Canes and one for the Preds, so play resumes at 4 on 3 (a 14-second Nashville power play, then 1:42 of four-on-four, and finally a Carolina power play for four seconds).",pie-en-argent,2023-10-07 04:14:01,171kr9k

One of the years that we were eliminated by the sharks in the first round I was there for the last game.  We stayed until the end when the players came out one by one to give a sendoff to the crowd.

Paul Kariya came over and handed me his stick over the glass.  It was my first stick and I kept it for years.  It was a left handed stick so I learned how to play hockey left handed.  I'm right handed and do everything but hockey right handed.

What all this means is that - even when there are aggressive and violent fights - players are expected to act with a certain degree of sportsmanship and respect for the official and unofficial rules of checks/fighting.

Pittsburgh their 3rd overall pick, 55th and Mikael Samuelsson to Florida for the 1st and 73rd pick. My guess is Florida was willing to trade away that 1st overall because they didn't need a goalie (had Lou) and knew their guy would be available at 3rd. Florida also had the 1st overall pick in 2002 and traded it to Columbus for their 3rd overall pick. CBJ selected Rick Nash, and Florida got the guy they'd been planning to get all along, Jay Bouwmeester. 1999 ATL traded their 2nd OA for the 1st overall pick from Vancouver (who wanted back to back picks to get the Sedins), but Vancouver had originally gotten the 1st overall from Tampa for the 4th overall and 2 3rd round picks. In 1998, Tampa got Lacavalier 1st overall after trading for that pick with Florida who had gotten it from San Jose. Nashville was the 2nd overall that year (Legwand) and Poile had traded up from the 3rd overall pick. 

So yeah haha it hasn't happened in 20 years, and the times it has happened its when the other team has a high pick and both GMs know that neither of them want to select who the other plans on selecting.

For a trade to work with Toronto I think it'll need to be in the neighborhood of 1st rounders in 2023 (via Boston) and 2024 and two top prospects (Knies and Minten is who I'd be asking for) plus Murray coming back more or less to offset the cap hit.  That is a lot to be asking but for, but Murray is made of glass and can't be relied upon and Samsonov is playing well above his career SV% of 0.906 this year at 0.915. Which is still below Saros career average of 0.919 for a very modest increase in cap of $312.5K for this year plus 2 additional years.",denverphil,2023-03-02 19:54:33,11gazov

BUT then I noticed he was slated to start on the Game-Day Preds at Panthers Preview on the Preds app this morning. Giving him a day off IS GREAT. It seems highly unusual that they would announce him starting and then not play him… ESPECIALLY with the current climate. It just doesn’t seem like a good time to have him listed and then pull him. You would think the coaching staff would know who they were playing more than 24 hours in advance of the game in a situation like this.

254,jnqurve,,"It seems poetic as Tkachuk described his game to be like Corey Perry by his own words, but just like Corey Perry, I will always root against Matthew Tkachuk no matter what team he is on. I just cannot get over how much I hate his actions on the ice after the whistle. He seems so talented, but he crosses the line WAY too much without real answer. Just more gloved punches.

I'd gladly see Eichel get a cup after his adversities, over Tkachuk and his shenanigans.

edit: I think a few florida fans found and brigaded this thread lmao. fucking nerds.",db741,2023-06-11 05:04:06,146jzov
255,jns0kkb,jnqurve,"The after the whistle stuff has to aggravate Florida fans almost as much I'd think, especially considering how much time it's cost him on the ice, either through penalties or injuries from 'payback' hits.  He's so talented and so obviously important to their team it's baffling he keeps doing the stupid stuff.",Sargentrock,2023-06-11 13:32:15,146jzov
256,jnsjn73,,"If the Preds can’t win as the 8th seed I don’t want to see anyone else win as the 8th seed. 😂

Super homer take but that’s how I feel. Lol",gekkoguy82,2023-06-11 15:56:48,146jzov
257,jnst8w4,,"Fuck Vegas.  I will always be salty for how favorable the expansion rules were for them, and even more so as the only team entering the league that year.  For them to win a cup only 6 years into the league, will never sit right with me.  Also, fuck Vegas.",Quagmire_gigity,2023-06-11 17:04:28,146jzov
258,jnsw7o4,jnst8w4,I'd like to second the fuck vegas opinion.,jbub73,2023-06-11 17:25:23,146jzov
259,jnqpm7x,,"I’m in the same boat as you, although I was hoping vegas would lose in a competitive series. But now, go Knights",farmerjim12,2023-06-11 04:09:07,146jzov
260,jnt3ayk,,Yep same 😂. Was neutral at first but Florida pulls so much unnecessary shit after the whistles. And then their fanbase blames reffing when Vegas plays a much cleaner game and Florida is 0-12 on the power play anyway. Plus I can’t stand Tkachuk or Bennett,l_C00KiE_l,2023-06-11 18:14:49,146jzov
261,jnsknx1,,"I’m just glad Florida is finally getting the hate they deserve. This team reeks of the same stench as the 2019 Blues: a goon squad being carried by a hot goaltender and a couple of clutch skaters. Yet everyone that isn’t a division rival views them as a likable underdog because they’ve never won a cup and some narrative of their success being some great “comeback story”.

I excused some of their antics and good fortune in the first round because the laughs at Boston’s expense were glorious, but the Toronto series really highlighted how much their team has benefited from one-sided officiating.",Aneides_Aeneus,2023-06-11 16:03:58,146jzov

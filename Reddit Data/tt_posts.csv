1,173vu0e,Film breakdown of Tennessee Running Game,"Another great film session by A to Z Sports Film Room. I haven't finished it all the way through yet, but a couple of things that stood out to me from the beginning of the video talking about tendencies:

- it's WILD to me that we can be at 66% shotgun usage and that's still 23rd in the least. I realized teams don't go under center as much anymore, but I didn't realize it was like this... sounds like half the league never goes under center.
- 49% motion usage... and I don't know if this number counts all the times they line a TE outside the formation and then motion him inside, which I don't feel like should count because everyone knows we're not running a play with a TE lined out wide, so what does this really help show you? I'm shocked we were in the top 10 of motion usage in the league the previous 4 years. We are terrible at using motion.  Also shocking that year over year for the past 5 years our motion usage has actually DECREASED, except for this season.
- 9% RPO... stunned it's this high. I feel like I rarely see us use it.
- the run philosophy has COMPLETELY shifted from the previous four years to this year.",titanate83,2023-10-09 16:16:01

Pairing him with Henry, Hopkins could build confidence.

3,173jdkv,The 2020 draft class is officially 100% busts,"With Fulton being as bad as he has been this year it is official that jrob missed on every single pick in the 2020 draft

RD1 Isaiah Wilson: no explanation needed

RD2 Kristian Fulton: Injured through his rookie season, actually had a pretty good 2021 year and then started to regress in 2022 and has become a liability on the field in 2023

RD3 Darrynton Evans: this pick didn’t make a whole lot of sense at the time considering Derrick was the leading rusher and he was really picked as a punt return guy. That being said injuries kept him off the field more than on the field and ended up playing more madden than actual football. Was cut after his 2nd year with the team and after being passed around to a few teams he has 125 career yards.

RD4 Larrell Murchison: played two and a half years in Tennessee and not putting up any stats of note. Was released in the 2022 season and signed by the rams where he notched his only 2 sacks of his career against Russell Wilson. 

RD7 Cole McDonald: was brought in as a project qb and didn’t even make the practice squad in 2020. Currently tearing it up in the XFL.

RD7 Chris Jackson: Not expecting much out of a 7th rounder but this guy played so much football for us and was terrible every time he set foot in the field. His best season came in 2021 where he wasn’t atrocious but wasn’t very good, mainly stepped in due to all of the injured that season. Is still currently on the practice squad.

9,173h9gx,Titans got beat at their own game today,"The Titans run defense, and the Titans run game was the Achilles heel of the team. The Titans threw the ball well and were good enough against the pass. Previous strengths looked like big weaknesses today. Run blocking was trash today, Titans look more like a passing team against good d-lines. The run game is a wasted breath when the O-line just can't block in the run game. 1 sack on the day. The Titans' offensive identity looks like it's going to have to be a lot different with the run blocking, looking like a bigger weakness than pass blocking vs the Colts.",Unlikely_Ad148,2023-10-09 02:47:57

This is not a Superbowl team, this is not even a playoff team anymore. We are unable to beat any decent opponent. We have no pass rush. We have blown money on players who are not contributing. We have drafted players in the first round who are clearly busts. Our future at QB is bleak and our current starter has hit his ceiling. 

At this point, with a lack of offensive and defensive weapons, I almost prefer to call it, and let the Jags take the South (not that they’re much better). Someone please change my mind.",patdino89,2022-12-17 15:00:07
6,dxhg4j,So... about Kaep (Hear me out),"EDIT: Don’t downvote just because you disagree please. The point of this post is to create a discussion, and if you have a different viewpoint I’d honestly like to hear it. Thanks.

EDIT 2: The downvotes are real y’all.



What if we sign Tannehill to a 2-3 year deal, sign Kaep as a backup, and either draft a QB this year or wait until next year?

This being TN, I know a lot of people wouldn’t be happy, but also Nashville is a pretty progressive town these days despite the demographics of the rest of the state. 


I think signing him at a reasonable price as a backup might be a smart move, especially after seeing the reports of his workout.

Also, if there was an organization capable of handling the media attention, it would be us. We don’t get a lot of attention anyway, and the team is filled with “team first” guys that don’t want the spotlight (with the possible exception of Lewan, who at this point needs to keep his head down anyway).

7,zuqq3n,I loved Malik Willis’s play,I think in the full context of the situation he is in and with his oline i was impressed by him. I counted 2 bad throws (one a ground ball near treylon’s feet and the first pick). Malik also showed his legs and ability to break sacks which impressed me immensely. I do not see why you would not be confident in Malik if we give him a good o line.,SlushyTheSeal,2022-12-25 04:40:42
8,16s5rbl,Real fans don't cheer for us to lose,"I get it, you want a new QB, but tanking for a potential to pick ain't the way to go.

Some of the better QBs are taken outside the top 10 (Love, Hurts, Howell, Purdy, Prescott, Jackson). The draft is gamble.

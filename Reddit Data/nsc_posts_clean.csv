I‚Äôve seen a lot of people who are thoroughly expecting a Miami win.  It‚Äôs understandable; after all, they‚Äôve got the best player of all time in their squad.  That said, let‚Äôs take a look back at how we got here.

We beat Colorado 2-1 and lost 4-3 to Toluca.  We beat Cincy, the current Supporters Shield leaders, in a penalty shootout.  We were down and out vs Club America, but the team still rallied, and after an absolutely farcical penalty shootout, we pulled through.  We thumped Minnesota.  We put on a resilient performance vs Monterrey.  We had, arguably, the tougher path to the final, as opposed to our opposition, who nearly lost it all to FC Dallas.

I‚Äôve been mentally preparing myself for all sorts of scenarios, including Miami being up 4-0 at the half and the match essentially being over.  However, I think what‚Äôs more likely is that we‚Äôre going to impress a lot of people who have never seen us play before, and may not have even heard of us.

Tonight, let‚Äôs show up and show out for the Boys In Gold.  Let‚Äôs sing at the top of our lungs the whole time.  Let‚Äôs give Messi an actual fight.

See you all at Geodis tonight! COYBIG üíôüíõ",OhShitItsSeth,2023-08-19 18:40:54

54,54,15wcncx,Thoughts after sleeping on it‚Ä¶,"1) our defense was spectacular. We gave Messi 2 looks all game (granted he almost converted both) but otherwise we took him out of the game
2) the key moment of the game for us was the 2 on 1 with Sam and Hany that we didn‚Äôt convert.  We should have, and then it would have been game over. 
3) Miami should have gotten a red for taking out Hany on a fast break in the 89th minute. And that would have had a real effect on PKs at the end. 
4) while it doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense putting Leal in the top 5 in pk since he‚Äôs been hurt and isn‚Äôt the best at PKs, in doing so it gave us a margin of error in case he missed (which he did as we know). It gave panicco 3 more chances to block one of theirs.  If we saved Leal to the 1 on 1 round panicco would have had to save theirs immediately.  Maybe it was a smart move in hindsight. 
5) I think our offense is much more complete with Sam, but it may be at Hanys expense.  Not that that‚Äôs bad overall, but will be interesting to see how Hany adjusts to not being our only option.  I don‚Äôt think he has yet, but I‚Äôm sure he will.  It will take a hit on his stats though. 
6) real questions exist around our goalie. Is Joe our guy and we just put panicco in cause Joe was out a week? Or has panicco earned the spot? Remember last year Joe got benched for performance reasons so he may not be the golden child with the coaches. Will be interesting to see‚Ä¶
7) the boys beat and played with the best on this continent.  I think we have every reason to believe they can run the table for this last stretch of the mls season.  Let‚Äôs go!!!",LetzGoBoyzNGold,2023-08-20 14:19:44

Long story short, Liverpool pissed me off so bad with this attempted Super League shit that I decided that while I'll always be a supporter, I'm not spending money on them anymore, and my soon-to-be-local club could *probably* use it instead. So I made the (somewhat rash) decision to pull the trigger on season tickets now, if only to guarantee priority for seats in the new stadium. 

Here's the kicker though: I've never been to a game, nor do I really follow MLS. In fact, I've only been to one MLS game in my life - the inaugural Portland vs. Seattle game in Portland 10 years ago (which was a blast). So I'm pretty pumped to now start attending games regularly.

So... yeah. There's no real point to this post, I just felt like sharing. But while I'm here, anything I should know about the club or attending games? Also, if anyone is looking for two tickets to this Saturday's game - or really any game between now and mid-June (lol), pm me.",conchobor,2021-04-22 00:54:50

The atmosphere at Geodis after Surridge put us ahead was electric, but the atmosphere after Fafa scored our second was genuinely a Top 5 all-time moment in the incredibly short history of our little club.  I think I speak for all of us when I say that it practically felt like we had already won the damn thing; the fans and the team were just beaming with confidence.  I think I hugged everyone around me after Fafa‚Äôs goal went in.

Much was made about the Leagues Cup tournament and how exciting the whole thing was, but Nashville SC‚Äôs exciting journey will honestly be my lasting memory from an otherwise disappointing season.

Instead of wasting more land to build expensive parking spots that will remain empty most of the time, y‚Äôall should be asking them to invest that money into game day buses/shuttles to Nashville neighborhoods. It would be more efficient and reduce congestion. And leave parking open to the people that actually need it‚Äîthose who are disabled, elderly, pregnant, or have very young kids. 

Infrastructure should be for people to enjoy, not cars. Parking spots cost a minimum of $10k PER SPACE to build, and that cost goes up significantly for garages. We will NEVER be able to build enough parking spots (or road lanes) to support everyone driving. If it was possible, other cities would have already done it. We should think about real solutions instead. I promise there are other options that would make the game day experience better for everyone, but if y‚Äôall only ever ask for parking we will never have better options.",genericplants,2022-04-08 02:01:59

230,230,jqy35a,So about that win...,"That win won me over!

I have been a member of this subreddit for around a year.  I never post anything, just keep up with what others are posting.  
I live in Knoxville and no one there broadcasts the games, so it's difficult to watch how the team is doing apart from highlights.  It's easier to watch ATL United games than Nashville SC games, so ATL United has been my MLS (Liverpool has been my main club since 2005.  5th generation band wagoner. Yes I stuck with the team through the recent darker times) club since they started. 

Once the return to play started, Nashville SC began to intrigue me.  I'm not afraid to support loosing teams. I loyally supported the Predators since 99.  I was OK with supporting the Preds even if they weren't doing well, as long as they were giving playing time to younger players.  So it's not that ATL United were or weren't successful, it's just that I could actually watch their games.

But what I saw last night was fantastic!  Coming up from the grasps of a defeat to tie it, then to score in extra minutes, it was a sight to see.  Not only is the club succeeding, but that win last night showed that they have a team culture (something that so many new teams of any sport lack) of working their asses off.  And I will faithfully support any club with that mindset!

So here I am, Nashville SC is now my MLS club moving forward.  I am proud to say the club now has 100% of my support!  I'm on board and I can't wait to wait 6 months to get my misspelled kit!!  Cheers!!",c_berry89,2020-11-09 14:00:56

What are your thoughts on using the Johnny Cash tune, God's Gonna Cut You Down (used in the pregame video, with easy stomp clap action) for inspiration(cred to u/grantland420, for the og idea). Here's my attempt (I'm not married to any of it):

You can run on for a long time

Run on for a long time

""Friendly Nashville SC fan here. Just wanted to say that we can‚Äôt wait to have you guys visit this weekend! It‚Äôs going to be a helluva matchday, and hopefully an even better game!

I recommend wearing warm clothing. The stadium sits on the Cumberland River, therefore it‚Äôs cold as hell after dark.

I recommend eating at any of the hot chicken establishments, as well as any of the restaurants outside of broadway. There‚Äôs a Predators game going on Saturday too (as of right now), so broadway will be a bitch & a half.

The NSC supporters will be having a tailgate in Lot R if you want to drop by and say hello, as we are extremely welcoming (remember USL/MLS friendly in 2018).

Again, we can‚Äôt wait to meet you guys & have an awesome matchday environment! Also get hyped for Judah & The Lions pregame concert; Lizzy Hales guitar solo!

If you have any questions about Nashville or Gameday, let me know! #COYBIG""

&#x200B;

I gotta say that if this is any representation of y'all's fanbase and city I must say I am impressed. 

The last time I was in your city, I was competing with the Atlanta Silverbacks against the intimidating Nashville SC. Your boys beat us up and down the field I think every time we played against them so I was not surprised when your city announced the MLS expansion. But this! THIS!!  


This is incredible. This is contagious. This is what the game is about. This is what the South is about! Let's make the ""Dixie Cup"" a legendary derby of hospitality and pride. I can't say how impressed I am with this energy. I want to offer you all the same when you come to visit us. If you ever need recommendations in Atlanta, want pro-tips for gameday, please I encourage you to reach out the same.   


We really are building something special here and the South has waited long enough to show their stuff on the big stage. While I'll always cheer for the Five Stripes first, I hope Nashville can find their footing and make their mark early because I think we all know the city's ""got the right stuff""",voluptuous_j,2020-02-25 21:38:29

Their support is great. The travel is amazing. I'm not an idiot. Those aren't problems.

The over eagerness to support the club no-matter what is a problem. Yelling throughout the announcement video was a turnoff.  
I think the overeagerness and takeover of sections and events that they do, limits the growth of the club. It limits normal fan and new fan interaction.  
Either until there's enough regular supporters to carry on to be a majority where new fans can fit in, the roadies are a turnoff. Supporting the club without question and drowning out the boos with cheers doesn't keep the club accountable.

Waking or sleeping, I must not forget Taylor‚Äôs great boon and in order to return his favor by day and by night, I should only think of fulfilling my loyalty.

Who is Taylor? For the blind, he is their vision. For the deaf, he is their music. For the mute, he is their voice. For the anosmiac, he is their aroma. For the numb, he is their feeling. For the atrophied, he is their muscle. For the starved, he is their sustenance. For the thirsty, he is their water. For the exhausted, he is their energy. For the depressed, he is their happiness. For the disillusioned, he is their hope. For the pessimistic, he is their optimism. For the disadvantaged, he is their champion. For the marginalised, he is their justice. For the oppressed, he is their salvation. For the righteous, he is their symbol. For the enlightened, he is their muse. For the erudite, he is their education.

If Taylor has a million fans, I am one of them. If Taylor has a thousand fans, I am one of them. If Taylor has a hundred fans, I am one of them. If Taylor has ten fans, I am one of them. If Taylor has only one fan, that is me. If Taylor has no fans, I no longer exist. If the whole universe is for Taylor, then I am for the whole universe. If the whole universe is against Taylor, then I am against the whole universe.

550,550,y5icci,Quality of MLS streams,"Now that the sting of yesterdays loss has lessened a bit, let‚Äôs talk about how terrible the stream quality was. Total garbage. I‚Äôm a huge disc golf fan and watch live tournament coverage pretty regularly. Their stream quality is quite a bit higher. And that‚Äôs coming from a fringe sport with almost no outside sponsorship. MLS has no excuse for providing such a poor fan experience considering their much deeper pockets and wider reaching advertising/sponsorship relationships. 


I realize that the AppleTV deal will likely fix this issue, but was really disappointing to switch over from watching live coverage of the Disc Golf Pro Tour Championships to find a significant drop in quality for the MLS stream.",squizzlr,2022-10-16 14:35:31

It helps greatly in getting people familiar with chants... especially those not immediately next to someone chanting.  I was really interested in hearing your chants on day 1... but other than seeing a capo miming/gesturing... couldn't make anything out.  Bolstering your drum core will also help greatly in getting more involvement.  As well as implementing some simple call/response chants that casual fans can easily/instantly pick up on.

That said, we had a great time and I look forward to seeing how y'all grow.  Welcome to the MLS.

619,619,at73vz,"The air has been cleared, there has been great feedback Now let's talk solutions!","Stephen from The Roadies,

First of all, I just want to say thank you to the OP of the original Roadies post.  I think this is probably a conversation that needed to be had a LONG time ago, but I still think it is better to have it now before we go MLS.  We are an SG that started off when the club started and had 5 members, never actually thinking we would have this growth. We are learning as we continue to grow, and we need everyones input, whether you are a supporter or not. We are going to be a part of the culture of soccer in Nashville, and will be here till the day we die. Our goal should to listen to every person, because every person will be affected by the songs, chants, pre game festivities, etc.

I had both my branding committee and my events committee read every single comment in this sub-reddit, as did I. Of course there was some bullshit to wade through, but there were a lot of things I did not even realize were happening within our SG.

We have already started coming up with a crap ton of solutions for the problems listed in the sub reddit, so I wanted to give y'all a heads up on what we are working on, and where we could use your help.

1. We are going to find ways to make it easier to communicate to members and leaders of The Roadies to pose suggestions and grievances.  I kinda started to see through all of this that Slack may not be the best communication method for everyone, including myself. I personally like to say stupid shit on Slack, but did not realize how it could be interpreted.  We are talking about having some sort of forum where people can talk and give their suggestions in a different context outside of Slack. (Possibly a Sub Reddit.) We want EVERYONE to suggest things, whether they are Roadies or not. We love our members, and will continue to listen to our members through current means, but I think we should listen to everyone. We are also going to have some sort of Roadies Social before away match watch parties, where if you would rather just talk to someone.  Our lives are all crazy busy, ( we dont get paid for any of this, we are all volunteers.) especially with the season starting. So I am thinking a social before away match parties is a good way to be able to talk about your suggestions and what you think about The Roadies and what we could do to improve.  Is this too little?  Too Much?   Id love your thoughts.
2. We want every single person to feel included and a part of the action for pre games and match days. Sometimes I think our Board sometimes gets a little overwhelmed for Match Days and we start to hibernate where we are comfortable. We are going to work on having more of our actual members be a part of welcoming people into the Soccer Culture in Nashville, and trying to get people on the fringes more involved.  We are going to do this by having some ""Roadies Ambassadors"" at our pre games and match days. These people are going to kings of fulfilling The Roadies atmosphere of encompassing everyone.  Whether it is pointing these people in the direction of like minded friends, trying to help out with songs and how we do things, or just trying to be a part of the community. I think having these ambassadors will be really good on taking pressure off the leadership of The Roadies, and gets people WAY more involved. We also want to feature our new members in articles, pictures, etc. The Roadies can be for everyone, we need to do a better job of showing it and doing it.
3. I definitely think there is a possibility we jumped the gun on the logo talk. I still personally love the logo and I am excited about it, but I dont represent all of The Roadies. We are going to work on a way for members to be able to present their opinions of the logo in a constructive manner to the club. Whether that is through the Trust, through an email, whatever. I think our members deserved to be heard, no matter their opinion.
4. Something we wanted to start doing that we need to work on better is establishing more fans not only in the city, but all around the suburbs as well.  We currently have a Murfreesboro chapter, but I would love to see this idea spread.   Don't want to start your own SG, but want to be around like minded individuals in Smyrna, Clarksville, Bowling Green, etc? Be able to watch matches with people in your area?  I think this is a great way to include everyone to be a part of what we are building.

&#x200B;

I think these conversations need to happen regularly and need to be constructive. We can only get better as supporters in Nashville if we work together.

Im not trying to plug anything here, but I REALLY do invite people to come to our pre match party tomorrow at Neighbors. Even if you wanna come get your free beer and food, flip me the bird, and walk out, I am cool with that. Id love to talk to everyone of you at a personal level and get to know you. I genuinely care about all of your ideas and suggestions, ( If anyone knows anything about enneagram personality types, I am a 2. It's a blessing and a curse.)

Got any other ideas or suggestions? Go ahead and thread them there. We are listening to y'all. We really are.

&#x200B;

Thank you all for your time.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: A lot of great feedback. We're not perfect but we are listening to you. We are working on ways to include more people on the fringes, and an easier way to voice opinions for members/non members.",PhStephenHD,2019-02-21 19:13:38

We had our first baby at the beginning of the season, so we haven't been able to go to many games, but we held onto our season tickets because we wanted to keep our seats for next season and beyond. We've either transferred our tickets to friends for free or resold for at or near face value. 

I just received an email, with no absolutely no warning, that our season tickets were being canceled due to too much resell. I understand the principle of wanting to prevent scalping, but it's wild that this happened so abruptly after so many seasons of loyalty to the club. 

All this to say: if you want to hold on to your season tickets, be careful about how often you resell.",corgistrong,2023-09-19 15:28:38

680,680,122p2tq,A Triad of Low Ambition,"1. A cheap ownership more concerned with looking the part for the sake of ""vibes"" and stadium experience without actually investing to make their product worthwhile and able to truly compete. This club loves making more of a big deal of a shirt collaboration or whichever random celebrity has signed on for an insignificant amount of ownership than doing what's necessary to challenge the rest of the league that is continuously getting better and supported with more resources (including clubs from similar sized markets and level of recognition).

2. A general manager keen on playing moneyball in a league systematically designed to maintain parity to the nth degree (already in favor of the cheap clubs). This isn't helped with an over-reliance on cap-friendly journeymen and veterans who are literally falling apart before our eyes, along with a, becoming more often than not, poor record of international signings in general.

3. A coach whose staunch tactics are meant to be safe (and because of that, friendly to cheap ownership) but not much else with limited ability to develop much on top of that besides ""pass to Hany and inshallah."" Tactics like that could've worked in MLS 13 years ago when he won, and even then, it was a stretch.


All three of these together makes us seem like a team from a bygone era of the league when there have been other teams (owners, management, coaches) in the time before, during, and after NSC's debut who are pushing their clubs and the league forward. We feel like an MLS 1.5-2.0 club if being generous.",Zheguez,2023-03-26 15:04:55

740,740,js9ikp,We Needed This,"I'm sure I'm not the only one that thought that the game against Orlando brought us back to USL times during that stretch of games where we would start down by a goal, clawed, scratched and fought to tie and eventually win the game in the last minute of the game. Back then, it was once said in broadcast ""what kind of deal have they struck with the Gods"".

&#x200B;

The team had shown back then that not only we were capable of scoring at any time but they also let everyone know that they were going to be a threat until the final whistle. That sense of urgency, sense of never ending fight, sense of never giving up, sense of ""we are not going down easy"" had not been seen in the MLS yet. Everyone thought we could do it, but until you see it happening at least once against a good team, it was hard to believe we had that in us. I think I speak not only for most fans, but also players and staff. We are after all a brand new team and we haven't had chances to prove ourselves.

&#x200B;

This Orlando game was probably one of the most important games and not because of the reasons we may think. It wasn't the 3 points that, granted, moved us up to 7th place (had we not played for a tie against Dallas we would be in 6th and still had our unbeaten record at Nissan since the Atlanta opener, yes I'm still salty). We were already in the playoffs (way before Miami by the way). What we got from this game is the mindset that we can come back from a deficit with no time left against the MLS is Back finalists. It brought the team together in the sense that they now KNOW they can beat a top team late in the game.

&#x200B;

Every single game, including the games where we were down by a goal ended in us defending the whole time, 10 players behind the ball inside our own box trying to keep our 1 goal lead or our 1-1 tie while the other team has 11 corner kicks and eventually scored (sorry I'm still salty at the Dallas game that they tied at the end). This is the first game where it seemed like we wanted it more. Yes, we got lucky and yes McCarty should have been sent of. Yes, maybe even Godoy should have been sent off also. That makes up for the BS ""indirect"" free kick that was never called back from the dangerous play leading to the Nani screamer.

&#x200B;

Going into the playoffs, this Orlando win is HUGE. Mentally it gives the team that certain ""we can do this"" mentality that you need in the playoffs and that you only get with experience. Experience we didn't get in the MLS is back tournament. Experience that we have never had with this group of guys. There is a lot of work to be done. But we needed this type of win in our bag of tricks. The players needed this. The fans needed this. EveryoneN needed this.

&#x200B;

Off we go to play the Pink Boys with their big wallets and even bigger (but bruised) egos. I'm not saying we are winning the MLS cup. What I'm saying is that it's going to take a team that puts up a great 90+ minutes in the pitch to beat us. Dark Horse SC is in full effect!",jmaza86,2020-11-11 14:54:58

776,776,fbwcte,An idea for an extremely simple call and repeat chant.,"So while i'm not a member of an SG a thing I admire about the backline is that people like /u/PhStephenHD /u/weburr /u/ryands1 /u/toilet-soup genuinely want to improve the over all quality of the experience of the full stadium. 

A thing that I noticed from my seats in 137 (my STH spot) last night that I don't want to go unnoticed. As we know there were a lot of atlanta fans all thru out the stadium last night. The majority of which I saw weren't SG types. These were older folks or kids or whatever. And they all got in on the extremely simple chants that were originating from the SS. Something as simple as ""ATLANTA"" and then ""UNITED"" was carrying around the stadium not because of its rhythm or wit, but because of its simplicity. Non SS fans were even able to start it themselves in their section which they did all night. 

If the backline is honest they get stadium wide buy in on one chant. The NSC corner claps. I'd argue it's because of the simplicty. 

All of that to say, I think a simple call and repeat 

""Nash""....""Ville"" starting in the backline and then calling out to the stadium would be a hit. You could even increase the frequency and build into a roar if you wanted. 

Anyways, I'm not an SS guy. But I think if you want 30k+ doing it, you've gotta work in something like that.

Surridge is definitely not 100%. Guy could barley jump for 50/50 balls. Surprised he played the full 90. 

MacNaughton has been huge. So just imagine how much better we will be in the back when Zimmerman is back. 

Leal seems to be creeping back into form. 

Looks like Hany and Shaffelburg are getting a bit gassed/frustrated/off-sync. A long break may do them well. Shaq on the other hand has been a consistent threat.  

Minus that Dax hustle and maturity. Middle of the formation needs work. Figure it out boys.

With the statement coming out today about the season still not likely to pick up anytime soon, I started to get even more sad, (even though I knew the answer).  I miss my soccer family so damn much.  As a leader of one of the Supporters Groups, we've spent all off season and planning on putting something incredible out there for all of Nashville, and it is tough not to be able to show what we can do as a fanbase.  There is just no way to keep up any excitement, with all the unknown going on.   


As y'all matter to me so much, I just wanted to check in.   


How's everyone doing?

As expected, Hany Mukhtar wins the final! The final tally was Hany Mukhtar- 273 vs Walker Zimmerman - 93. If I'm being honest, I thought the final would be closer and it probably would have been before the World Cup. Zimmerman did not have a great tournament, or a great showing during a USMNT friendly just last week. Still, he's already an all time great for Nashville SC and has the potential to win another MLS Defender of the Year.

Hany was the runaway favorite since the beginning, and I know some people thought it was pointless to have a tournament in the first place since these were the top two guys but I enjoyed thinking about my favorite (or least favorite) memories of all of these players during their individual matchups. 

In hindsight, I would have seeded a few guys differently. Teal was too high, Washington was too low. But hey, maybe in a few years we'll do another version of this. Plus, some of y'all were clamoring for some more USL players. I want to spend some time to get familiar with the history of the club before their MLS days, that's just not knowledge I have right now. Not promising anything, plus it would be redundant to have a tournament again so quickly, but if this was ever done again it's clear that it should be done by someone who knows the club's history, ALL of it.

Some data to round out this post, the largest margin of victory for any matchup was Hany Mukhtar winning 97.4% of the vote against Dave Romney in the quarterfinal. The closest race was between Joe Willis and Randall Leal, with Joe winning just 50.8% of the vote. That one was decided by just five votes! I also counted up the number of votes of the entire tournament and although I know this is not the number of individual voters, 5,705 votes were cast throughout this tournament. So I just want to say one final thank you, for participating, for feedback, and for making this a fun way to spend a pretty quiet offseason. We're less than a month away from matchday 1, and I'm excited to see the boys in gold for season 4. Hope you enjoyed the tourny! #COYBIG #EveryoneN",12sammy2,2023-01-30 17:43:40

997,997,jgmei5,**Knocks on wood.** Let's talk clinching playoffs,"We currently sit 5 points ahead of Atlanta and 6 points ahead of Miami with a game in hand.  

Here are their remaining schedules:

**Atlanta:** *I see 6 points...maybe 9 points if Columbus rests starters because they can't catch Philly on Decision Day. If they only manage 6 points, we just need one more win to lock up playoffs. If Atlanta peels off 3 wins out of last 4 matches, 2 wins in our last 5 gets the job done.*

v. DC

@ Orlando

v. Cincy

@ Columbus


**Inter Miami:** *A little harder to predict. But my guess is a range of 4 points to 6 points.  This means even if we lose out - we still may clip them based on goal differential*

v. Orlando

@ Dallas

@ Toronto

v. Cincy

1007,7,17qoz5z,Let's Play GM,"This is a non Gary discussion. I want him gone, but I know the FO won't do it this offseason. So let's talk about who is on the roster currently. Who do we keep? Who needs to go immediately? Who needs to be phased out? We'll talk about only guys who play a fair amount.

Joe Willis (35), $375k- he's an average GK for this league. You can expect a few years more of the same level, but his contract does expire this season. I say let him walk and keep panicco ($89k) who can do a similar job for much cheaper.

Dan Lovitz (32), $551k- I think he is rapidly approaching a cliff. His passing quality dropped a lot this year, and he was prone to a few baffling defensive errors. His left footed corner kicks are valuable, but how much can you pay for that given regression elsewhere. If he's willing to take a significant pay cut, bring him back, otherwise show him the door.

Walker Zimmerman (30), DP- He is still a great defender for this league, but he is regressing. The next chance you get to buy down his DP status, do so.

Lukas Macnaughton (28), $85k- He is a solid 3rd option/starter when needed. Due for a modest raise, but he can be great depth at a reasonable price for a long time.

Jack Maher (24), $260k- He is a solid defender, doesn't offer as much on set pieces as Walker or Mac though. He'll be due for a modest raise. Keep him at a reasonable salary.

Shaq Moore (27), $725k- He is a solid defender, and decent in the build up. He is under contract for 2 more years, so you keep him, but we should expect more from him given his salary.

Anibal Godoy (33), $750k- His age has caught him. He can possess the ball reasonably well, but passing and speed are greatly diminished. Significant pay cut or let him go.

Dax McCarty (36), $275k- If he wants to come back, let him. There is still a role for him, it's not every game starter, but he can bring value. If he will play for cheaper, even better, but $275k is not bad for a veteran depth piece.

Sean Davis (30), $825k- He really fell out of favor 2nd half of this season. He is under contract for one more season. I don't think we really have any other option but to keep him and hope he re-finds better form. You probably can't keep him after this season at that salary.

Alex Muyl (28), $500k- I think he has value as a utility player. A guy who can start in multiple positions in a pinch. Keep him, but bring in enough players that he doesn't have to be a starter.

Randall Leal (26), $1.1M- His body is not cooperating with him. I can't believe he's only 26. You can't keep him at his current salary. If he is willing, cut it in half at the least and you can keep him. Otherwise there's just too much risk.

Fafa Picault (32) $650k- Decent production for his salary. If you can bring him back for similar, do it.

Jacob Shaffelburg (23), $195k- Solid, young and still improving, under contract.

Hany Mukhtar (28), DP- Keep obviously, but there is a world where the team regresses even more next year and you are forced to decide to sell high or not.

Sam Surridge (25), DP- The quality is obvious, but we need to build the team around his strengths. We are not currently built in such a way.

Teal Bunbury (33), $470k- This is not a bad price for a backup striker. Evaluate the market to see if there is a better option. If there is, great. Otherwise it wouldn't be the worst thing to bring him back.

Fringe players/backups- We desperately need more here. There's really only 2 players: Anunga and washington you can even consider putting into a real game. And when you do you just hope they don't make a critical error. All other players we need upgrades desperately.

1108,108,160grc0,Regional MLS Rivals,"Every club needs them, every fans need rivals.

NSC is still a new club but still no ¬´¬†named¬†¬ª regional rivalries, we‚Äôve yet to play any Tennessee club in US Open Cup and those will be rare. 

I know a lot of folks mentioned Cincinnati but here‚Äôs why I think Atlanta United should be our main rivals.

1. Atlanta United ¬´¬†southern derby¬†¬ª , on their official website they listed regional rivals as Charlotte and NSC to their schedule. Their fans also comes by huge numbers when we host them which is awesome to create some rivalry. Kinda like Club America but more local. Since they officially announced us as regional rivals, should we not officially toy with them and get a rivalry started? 

2. Cincinnati FC this one was obvious at first and officially we tried to create a rivalry but they denied seeing it as a rivalry, they already have rivalries with two Ohio clubs so they treat us as a normal game. Maybe one day we will have a Kentucky club like Louisville that we can forget about Ohio altogether.

3. Other Potential rivals - Charlotte FC and St Louis City FC are both new clubs who don‚Äôt have rivalries either, both are 5hr drive so not so bad for travelling fans. Could have mentioned Columbus but since Cincy does not see us as rivals then that won‚Äôt happen.

1244,244,15kg1zx,Looking for used Nashville SC tickets/accreditations/field passes for my collection,"Hi to all Nashville SC supporters,

as a ticket collector living in Germany, I'm always looking for MLS related tickets (all seasons, all teams; league, US Open Cup, CONCACAF cups, Leagues Cup, friendlies) for my collection. Unfortunately they are hard to find in europe. Some of you really helped me 2 years ago, so I give it a new try. At this moment I have 1.094 different game tickets from MLS start until today.

If you still have old tickets in a shoe box under your bed, in a drawer or a storage and want to give them a ""second life"" in a collection, please PM me! üôèüèºüòÉ I would offer to cover the shipping costs, of course.

I know MLS ticketing is digital now and the younger ones may never held any physical ticket in their hands, but maybe there are some other things similar to tickets flying around? Some MLS clubs still print in some cases, like if a phone is broken and its not possible to enter with the ticket app. Maybe you have a field pass or printed accreditation from any game which technically comes closest to a physical ticket? Would be sad if they will end in a paper bin one day.

Regards from Germany!! üòâ

A friend offered me his tickets to an upcoming match and I don't have anyone to watch the youngest this time, so I thought I would bring him.  Problem is:  I was only given 4 tickets and if he comes, I need a fifth.  

So here's my question -- he JUST turned 3 (his birthday is last week) and based on my experience with other sporting events he's attended, a couple of predators games and a sounds game -- he insists on sitting on a lap anyway.  If we wanted to try to pass him off as two, which visually isn't hard to do, is there any kind of validation required, or are they just going to take my word for it?

1349,349,14kghwq,slight frustration,"Overall, I think MJ has done a fantastic job building this team, I even like the Loba and especially Piniero signings and I believe GS simply didn't know how to use them properly ( and Piniero had some other issues going on with culture shock as well, if I remember correctly), but its really frustrating that we haven't just signed at *least* one striker and midfielder on non-DP contracts last winter and again this summer. I assume we are getting a DP striker, but that shouldn't be stopping us from replacing Zubak and upgrading Teal as well. There have been options available and other teams are making signings there. GS is simply way too stubborn and slow about incorporating players into the lineup to the point that it makes no sense, IMO. he coaches out of fear and ""not to lose,"" which has been successful in terms of navigating us into the playoffs, but that isnt' a recipe for silverware once we get there. There is absolutely no reason not to have made a striker signing and even brought up some HCFC guys to get minutes at this point. I mean even when we are at full strength with Teal up top, it isnt' like he is a difference maker, we could easily audition people or drop someone else in with little practice and not see much of a drop off even if they were a worse player considering all we ask Teal to do is stand around up top and attempt to back into guys to hold the ball and pass it back, or jsut stand up there and hope the asinine long ball bounces through 2 defenders and he's able to corral it long enough to pass it into the corner to shaq who we ask to subsequently dribble deeper until he is completely cut off from the attack and try to bounce it off a defender for a corner.",snashboot,2023-06-27 15:17:05

I also noticed the pinned post for May's ticket exchange.  So I'll keep an eye out for the June one as I'd rather help someone out and buy tickets from someone in the community rather than directly from the team or a secondary market.

1572,572,12o8cfg,what GS tactics would we like to see change?,"We talk a lot about something changing around here but rarely dive into what specifically should. So I was curious on everyone's thoughts on that. 

One tactic I would love to see changed, especially since our propensity for dribbling to the corner and crossing is so well known at this point ( and no longer working), is to stop having all of our attacking players run forward in a line when we get the ball down on the wings waiting for a cross, and ( along with moving Hany back to midfield) having midfielders ( like Hany) drift back wards, or running late into the top of the box for a cut back pass to feet rather than our traditional cross. Thats exactly how Hany got his goal last night and that setup creates a much better chance for a quality shot rather than just putting it into the box for a 50/50 ( at best) ball, especially when teams know thats all we know how to do on offense. In addition to this top of the 18 tactic, as teams begin to become aware of that, the next phase would be having Hany or another attacker ( or a wingback like Moore), drift out in support of the player who has dribbled into the corner so that, rather than cross it, the can combine for a 1-2...and *then* still have that late run to the top of the 18 for a shot, or at least the quick passing from the corner will allow for the other attackers that have made their runs into the box the ability to make shifty movements to get open for more quick, tight passing in and around the 18 to open things up, rather than the very static and tired cross after cross or just hope for a corner that we do.",oldboot,2023-04-16 13:23:00

Also want to keep it within an hour of the stadium at most. Thanks y'all.,Lord_Xp,2023-03-21 02:06:01

1652,652,11vbrxj,Serious Question - You Suck,"A question of pure ignorance, I‚Äôm not trying to troll, but simply trying to understand. Why does the SS lead a ‚Äúyou suck, it‚Äôs all your fault‚Äù chant? I could care less about the away players‚Äô feelings but it‚Äôs a chant that doesn‚Äôt get used in any other pro soccer setting (to my knowledge) and for anyone that has played soccer (or hockey) it‚Äôs generally understood that it‚Äôs not usually the GK‚Äôs ‚Äúfault‚Äù in the first place. If these chants aren‚Äôt a good look for us as a fan base and really don‚Äôt have a place in pro soccer, yet they persist. Why?

Edit: this appears to be a sensitive question! Others I‚Äôve spoken with have brought up a good point though ‚Äî in American football terms it‚Äôd be the same as razzing a WR for an interception that was thrown into triple coverage by the QB. Not the WR‚Äôs fault so the crowd giving him heat for it would be kinda dumb. Right?

I‚Äôm all for a good time and making Geodis a tough place to play but seems like away players that laugh at the chant are probably laughing at us, not with us lol.",yankeecartel,2023-03-19 04:53:15

1669,669,11qoj4m,Roses for Gary After Three Weeks," I probably defend Gary more than most folks around here but after just three weeks the Boys in Black (Gold if we ever wear it again) are looking sharp. Winning the home opener without starting Mukhtar was something that,if asked before the game, most would agree asked a lot of a questionable front line while also sporting Leal freshly playing the 10.
 Then traveling to New York and getting a draw. Making that second game as big a point as it was to have watched it. 
 The return home asked a bit more of our beloved Yotes/strings/etc on a cold rainy night under the Geodis Lights. Our club from the neighborly neighbors of the north were controlled thought the 90 and the Castle seems a fortress once more. 

 Flowery language aside Gary has found his offense finally and it's not going to be the beautiful game of possession and progression. Instead he's finally finding some goals and chances playing his defensive game while employing a blistering counter on the wings and a focal point capable of winning headers/playing the ball on to runners.  Gary is finally showing what his system CAN look like and for that he deserves some love. Now to take this attacking form on the road to the Rev and go to 10 in 12. #COYBIG

1670,670,11qkkzq,Leagues Cup Bracket,"So I got the email about Leagues Cup tickets and I noticed the total possible cost seemed pretty high... So I took a close look at the bracket and format to see how many games we could in theory host. If we win our group (and assuming we continue to win) we would host R32, R16, and QF games guaranteed, with the possibility to host SF and Final depending on who also makes it there.

I know it hasn't started yet, but I hope we go for it in this comp. I was disappointed we missed out on USOC semi and final hosting chances last year.  I know for whatever reason in the US teams only prioritize MLS, but I think we should go for one of these other trophies",LFCs95,2023-03-13 20:24:30

1709,709,11dsx0l,Is there any news on Godoy?,"Sure looked like he dislocated his shoulder during the match. Haven't heard or seen any update, but maybe I missed something. Anyone heard something?",aanmc95,2023-02-28 01:20:35
1710,710,11djyny,MLS Season Pass,"Anybody shared their subscription with a friend yet? Looking to give access to some others, but I believe you have to make them a part of your ‚ÄúApple Family‚Äù. Was wondering how easy it was for others and if it screwed any of your personal accounts through Apple up?

Edit: Just added one of my friends to our family. Pretty sure I screwed it up ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ. They had one of my shared albums on their phone. I don‚Äôt think they have my iCloud storage? Any thoughts are appreciated.",kevdawgie7,2023-02-27 19:09:36
1711,711,11dhfsi,Was I wrong or was this false hope?,"Like many, I spent most of last season and all of the off season spouting my many issues with the way Gary set up the team and the choice of players he often chose to field. From not utilizing Loba correctly (IMO) to heavily depending on Hany I was sure this season was going to be filled with all the same issues as last season. But I was... wrong? I know it's just one match, but the team played with a breath of fresh air we only saw on the best occasions last season... and without Hany for 70 odd minutes. Shaffleburg was excellent on and off the ball and looked extremely comfortable, Fafa with an incredible debut, Godoy and Davis setting up very strong together, the whole backline moving fluidly and working together. The team played positively and seemed to work really well in transition (which was one of the biggest issues for the team last season imo). The boys also stayed on the front foot AFTER opening the scoring which is not something we could often say last season. And then when Hany came on... my goodness. The link up play potential he will have if he isn't being constantly relied on to score will be limitless. If you go back and watch the 2nd goal, when Hany gets on the ball 4-5 NYCFC players all turn to him and completely forget about Shaff, setting up the easy goal for him. Set pieces looked good and the defense seems just as strong as ever, with Joe making some great saves as well. 

Now I won't act like it was a perfect match. I thought Leal was decent at best and Teal was fine but no where near the level of a No. 9 in this league (think Loba would have been wonderful with Shaff and Fafa beside him and Hany behind him). A few quick mistakes in the back led to some solid chances for NYCFC but nothing terrible. 

But overall setting up in the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 was superb and perfect for this team as opposed to the pseudo 4-4-2 we often played last season. Hany playing in that advanced midfield/playmaker role with great pieces around him is perfect for his profile and he could bag more assists than goals this season. (My heart wants him to be prime Ozil)

&#x200B;

So, was this just one game? Or has Gary actually fixed the issues that plagued us last season? I'm a cynical sports fan at heart and have been outspoken against Gary, but something seemed different on the pitch this weekend.",Supahot28,2023-02-27 17:28:31

There wasn't a huge incentive for us to go public transit last year because we were Season Ticket Members from way back, and got good parking at the beginning of the season.  As the situation has gotten less certain, I've looked more and more into WeGo, but I'm concerned about getting out of the area after the matches.

So, does anyone have experience going to and from matches on WeGo buses?  In particular, does Metro deploy more buses for busy times?  Has anyone had to wait a long time to get onto a bus?  And, I guess since I'm asking specifically I'll also ask for general comment on the quality of the experience using WeGo.

I know last season's live streams and over-the-air broadcasts weren't perfect and left out many fans, but at least they were free. I also know that MLS Season Pass is a good deal for the superfans who like to watch a lot of MLS. But this is really bad for the more casual fans who might only watch a few matches here and there.

I was an international student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (I-L-L!) and have only resided in Illinois throughout my stay in the US before graduating last December. I like what I've seen in Nashville thus far (which is of course the touristy stuff. Yes I mean, Broadway avenue \[side note: I love classic rock and almost paid 30 bucks to enjoy a live performance of whole lotta love there\] and ofc Hattie B's :)).

I am looking for people of around my age (24 y/o guy myself) to chill with on the weekends or evenings on a weekday. I like watching and playing most sports (will see the super bowl game itself and not just the halftime show this time) and it is soccer (the real football) which I follow the most (rooting for man city's downfall lmao). I love going on hikes and camping in national/state parks/reserves/forests in the US (need a nature break at least once a month tbh). I was able to see a family of black bears when I visited Tennessee's very own Great Smoky Mountains National Park last fall (after failing miserably at the Rocky Mountains).

I plan on staying in and discovering the Music City and would love some good company in doing so. Please feel free to reply on this post and connect w/ me if you or your group of friends are hanging out and have a vacant stool at a sports bar/a seat at a bonfire in a camping site/a spot in the badminton court or soccer team in one of these days!",EmphasisJazzlike151,2023-02-09 18:19:52
1789,789,10y0gce,My ONLY defense of the octagon,"I hate the octagon in our crest. As best as I can gather, it's only part of it because it represented the footprint of [the first design of our stadium](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/09/20/nashville-mls-stadium-construction-contract/1366972002/). I'm hopeful that someday I can buy a jersey where the crest is just the soundwave N, but the [Johnny Cash promo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoXzy9sO3W_/) at Bicentennial Mall makes me think it's not going anywhere any time soon.

But now I think I have one little, tiny defense of the octagon?

I pointed out the similarities between our soundwave N and FC Nantes' new crest (as of 2019) to a friend of mine, which led me to this graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tq0r7evp67ha1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=4721d5832eb93dc10da6ad3ea64d0cc4bdcb0b90

The first two FC Nantes crests were contained in octagons. Then, I found out that Stade Rennais FC's crest [adopted their own octagon in 1997](https://1000logos.net/rennais-logo/). My search was in no way exhaustive, but I couldn't *easily* find any other uses of octagons in soccer other than these two French clubs. Which leads to my defense.

The city of Nashville has a little bit of French history, with the area having been used by French fur traders right before Robertson, Donelson, et al. arrived to set up what would eventually become the city. That history is acknowledged on the city seal in a *fleur de lis*‚Äîan element that was part of [the old Nashville FC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_FC) crest years ago, as well. Although the French element was removed from the seal for the USL team's identity, perhaps people like me who have strong, negative feelings about the octagon can retcon it‚Äîin our minds, anyway‚Äîas a distinctly French element that pays homage to Nashville's little bit of French history.

At least until we can finally drop it for good.",nodgih,2023-02-09 17:26:41

And we've made it to the final! Today is the big one, I first want to say thank you for participating and making the offseason go by quicker because of this bracket. I hope you all felt the same way.

But now it's time to introduce our finalists (although they need no introduction)! On one side is Hany Mukhtar, the two-time MLS MVP finalist and your reigning MLS MVP! His opponent, Walker Zimmerman, the USMNT alumni and two-time MLS defender of the year! They were the 1-seeds for a reason, now they face off in the finals! 

I will keep the poll for this matchup open all weekend and post the results on Monday. Happy voting!

Also, if Nashville gets an MLB club, they should name it the Nashville Brigadiers (an ode to Francis Nash, the man the city was named after and also related to the Vanderbilt Commodores)

Hi everyone! I've seen this trend on a few other subs and wanted to try it out here! This is a tournament to decide who is the all-time fan favorite NSC player! We're three seasons in now, so we've seen a fair amount of players come into the club, and a handful go out. This bracket has players that are both still on the roster, and a few that have already moved on from the club. Also, I'm sorry if the seeding isn't something you agree with, or if I missed a player. These were the players I thought were most representative of the club's past as well as its current state.

There will be one matchup every single day until a winner is decided! The polling will be open from the beginning of the day until midnight, and I'll post the results the next morning. Tomorrow will be our first matchup between #8 Taylor Washington and #9 Jacob Shaffelburg! I hope everyone enjoys this little tournament as an attempt to hold us over to the beginning of the season!",12sammy2,2022-12-27 19:32:39

I just started keeping up with Nashville SC this year. I‚Äôve watched several games, check the outcome of every game, and have been watching the standings closely as the playoffs drew nearer. I was hopeful for the chance to go to a home playoff game, but nonetheless excited to watch our club on tv play LA. 

I am utterly dumbfounded the MLS scheduled this game 30 minutes before the Tennessee vs Alabama game. I wonder truly how many viewers have been lost due to this blunder. It‚Äôs so disappointing that one of the best opportunities to grow the fanbase to casual viewers has been utterly squandered because they‚Äôll be watching college football instead. Is this the sort of foresight we can expect from the MLS going forward?

2967,21,fzom30,Concerns about the Supporter Section,"I've grown up in Nashville and always wanted an MLS team. I went to the announcement at the Country Music Hall of Fame and various other Nashville SC events. Watching Nashville lose to FC Cincinnati in penalties during the USL Playoffs in 2018 was one of the most upsetting moments in sports that I had experienced in a long time. I am prefacing this post with these facts to attempt to show that I truly am a fan. I do, however, have a small concern with the supporter culture of NSC that I think should be addressed. Every time I see a game, the supporter's section seems a little weird to me: 

1. The fans don't seem to care about what happens in the game as much as they seem to care about showing that they are the club's biggest supporter. The flags, scarfs, and (extremely overpriced) jerseys are great, but I want some people out there screaming at the refs, losing their minds at a goal, or sitting in disbelief at a lose. This is not the case, though.

2. It is a very homogenous group of people. I too am a white man, but I think it might be kinda nice so see some people from all over Nashville in there.

3. The chants are slightly below par: they feel forced and unnatural.

It may just be the novelty of the club that is causing these things, but I came onto reddit in search of some concordance with other fans (or to be proven wrong).",jow19,2020-04-12 02:48:03

2971,25,aqa48j,Taking Pride in our Name / Nashville Atlas FC's Legacy,"I wrestled with our name for awhile, some days I loved it, other days I wished it was more unique. I came to realize I do love that it's Nashville SC for a different reason and want it to stay (and believe it will) for more than just it sounds nice.

  
I love it when I hear players, fans, podcast hosts or others refer to ""coming to/playing for Nashville"" or ""Nashville's doing well"" or ""Nashville's got to work on this"". It feels like it refers to more of our whole community than just a team. You sometimes get that with the Preds being referred to as Nashville, but barely and not in the same vein, and hardly at all with the Titans with Tennessee (just US pro sports here in general).   


It makes our team fully represent our community, not just be a team that resides in our community. I love that.  


As for nicknames, the cool thing is that they can be whatever you want it to be. Maybe it'll catch on or maybe not, so what! If that's how you want to show your love for our club, by all means, go for it and call them however you want (be it Fiddlers, Bluebirds, Tonkers, Boys in Gold, Villains, etc.). They can be different for everybody, (even if and when a universal one appears) that's why it's fun.  


For me, I've decided to nickname our team, our whole community/fanbase really, as Atlas. This is in honor of our diverse community supporting each other and our club in both good times & bad times and to [Nashville Atlas FC](http://logos.wikia.com/wiki/File:Nashville_Atlas_FC_logo.png), the club that [merged with Nashville FC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1U8IzJKZho&t=5s). Their mission was being a club with the aim of building a community that celebrates and champions the multicultural and diverse people of Nashville. I'm proud to say that's an aim we as fans and NSC still carry today (Plus it sounds cool).  


But that's just me and that's okay. Do what you want to do to celebrate our team and community if you so choose. In the end, we all support this team and that's what it's all about. ",Zheguez,2019-02-13 19:04:18

I guess seeing all these posts about inflated ticket prices for the opener has really saddened me. The affordable option to enjoy local professional sports was one of the things that I really loved (and hopefully still can love) about this club. It provides an invite for everybody to enjoy this game and more importantly this club that we love so much.

I know a lot of us were looking to our southeast friends in Charlotte and pointing the finger at their situation going on with their tickets. Although much of this is out of a lot of our control, if we‚Äôre not careful, soon we too may be facing the same  dilemma, leaving our men to play in front of empty seats.",kevdawgie7,2022-04-06 15:42:00

&#x200B;

I feel we suffered for it and the team suffered for it because USL could have been better if we treated it like an actual team rather than filler before next season. The players deserve it and the fans deserve it. Instead we get an ugly logo that looks like a pharma brand and an ugly too big stadium to play in. Could have held off on MLS until the Fairgrounds stadium was ready and focused on a really good USL experience. FTP is actually a really nice place to watch a soccer game. Nissan stadium is too big unless the team manages to fill it somehow. If they don't will it be oh well. Our own stadium soon?

I was so excited when the club hired him on. What a get! He worked at Liverpool then wherever then wanted to come to Nashvegas? To borrow from the Brits bloody brilliant. I was on board and on the NSC train full speed ahead!  


First decision? That ugly ass crest. I know this is beating a dead horse and the majority of people didn't/don't care but when other clubs have missed the mark they've gone back to the drawing board. Not NSC. Just an ugly bland crest in hi-lighter yellow don't call that gold. Next major decision was Gary Smith some people hated it. I think he wasn't an exciting get but I wasn't gonna cry about it. Then with more branding the club wanted to name the supporters section the row or the alley or the stockade. I think those were the choices. OUR BRAND IS BLAND. Someone saved us so thank you sweet savior but that shouldn't have had to happen.  


I can't tell you about the team because we haven't seen them play and part of the reason is because they got kicked from the MLS is back tournament. This is the last straw! NSC gets kicked out and we don't know who is sick and who isn't and I hope everyone recovers don't get me wrong. But wehn fans have honest questions about it because the players socials accounts show them on Broadway right before a tournament or then the team all sat on a bus for hours not knowing if some one had the virus but Ian Ayre says he is MAD at them for asking the questions. Hey buddy maybe they followed guidelines but maybe your team should have had slightly strickter guidelines then the general Broadway population who think masks are against their rights.. And if you are mad maybe dont take it out on the fans who can't watch their team play now. Go on and downvote though if you think the team shouldn't care more about fans and the biggest fans to boot.",Unknown,2020-07-19 22:55:58

In an actual logo I would also change the Roman numerals to MMXX for the inaugural season.  Please comment if you like the idea, but we deserve better than the cheap design that was delivered.

3004,58,lbrxbi,The Backline and 24/7,"Hi everyone. I wanted to use this forum to help clarify what transpired with the 24/7 sponsorship and hopefully lend some perspective to the entire situation. To begin with, I'm a member of the BSC board and speak for myself only and not on anyone else's behalf. If you try I'm sure you can figure out who I am. 

Unfortunately, /u/tklane 's account is neither fun nor factual. There was no bad faith action taken by EFSG or any of our other member bodies. This was a representative democratic process that returned a result MANY of our members are strongly opposed to. Toby's timeline is largely accurate. EFSG was approached by 24/7 with a sponsorship proposal in late 2020. EFSG could have received the entire sponsorship themselves but made the decision to bring this to the BL in an effort to bolster our shaky financial footing. As I'm sure you've all noticed, this was a rough year for us to try to establish ourselves. We do not have any preexisting sponsorships and we made the decision to waive the small financial contribution per member every SG contributed for operating expenses for 2021, as we feel that no one received return on that investment in 2020. Like many, we are in survival mode. 

The original proposal was to distribute funds to all of our member SGs and keep 20% for the BL, with EFSG receiving a larger share as the finder's fee. There was no manipulation, no hiding the ball, no funny business. Everyone was honest and transparent. Without regard to 24/7, the sponsorship structure itself was then brought up for a very lengthy board discussion. In the end, we decided that establishing an incentive for member SGs to seek out economic partnerships was in our collective best interest, but that the Backline needed to be the primary beneficiary of any sponsorship. At this point, we drafted a policy outlining that structure and voted to adopt the sponsorship policy. At the time of the AGM, the sponsorship policy was not yet finalized and we had nothing to announce. 

At this point I think a brief interlude is necessary. In our short existence, we've had countless complaints from our members, but very few solutions. Since working together fabulously for the Feb 29 opener, many of us have reverted back to our clans, making the Backline's job increasingly difficult. We exist to foster collaboration. This proposal was among the first attempts to better our collective. And for that reason, I urge you all to reconsider any finger pointing at EFSG. They tried when no one else did. Not a single voice came forward offering alternative ideas.  

Upon adoption of the sponsorship policy, the 24/7 proposal was brought back to the board for a vote. At this point, there had been internal discussions among all of your SGs and Stephen Robinson emailed the board stating the reasons for the Roadies' opposition. Because of the nature of this development, each Backline board member conferred with their SG board. Every SG board member registered a vote and their collective vote was registered by their board representative. If you're a member of an SG, you had a say in this through your vote for your board members. More than one Backline board member's personal vote was overridden by their SG board's vote. This was a contentious decision. Ultimately, we are bound to follow the bylaws that we all agreed upon. The vote passed. I can't stress this enough: we are bound by our bylaws. Bylaws that every SG agreed upon. 

Since the announcement last night, an avalanche of dissatisfaction has been dropped on our heads. Trust me: we hear you. None among our ranks are going to argue on behalf of Tina Hodges' moral bona fides. I can't speak for everyone's personal motivations, but you board representatives voted on this by weighing many complex interests. 

There are many difficult jobs in this silly little ecosystem, but I'd put this one up against any. Harder still is social media admin for The Backline. It's impossible to speak with one voice when we have so many. If everyone thought the same way and had the same views and same sense of humor, we would all choose to join the same SG and none of this would ever be a problem. But that's not the case and we have to work together. Please know that our twitter admin can't clap back at you. They work for you. And they get paid $0 and a lot of stress. 

Our twitter admin can't point out that we all line the pockets of a billionaire that makes substantial political contributions to Marsha Blackburn. I personally don't believe any person should be defined by such a thing. We rightly think Ingram's a great owner. You're all entitled to register your dissatisfaction, but I think it's fair to give you a bit of a peek behind the curtain. 

There will be more to come on this, but I felt we owe it to all of you to give you a bit more background. There will be discussions among the board and the SGs about paths forward. We all operate under codified standard to engage in good faith with the Backline. Perhaps that needs to be redefined. Again, I'm speaking for myself and not for the board as a whole. None of the foregoing is confidential or guarded in any way.",BLSC_Rep,2021-02-03 16:50:19
3005,59,xszk0m,Idea for fan engagement at games!,"I watch a lot of Italian, and German football, and something hit me this morning as I was watching the Serie A. We should have our PA announcer ‚Äúhype up‚Äù the crowd by starting one of Chants that the supporter section is doing, joining the supporter section, or even something as simple as after a goal having the crowd finish a phrase he/she says. I‚Äôve noticed that GEODIS isn‚Äôt always as loud as it should be during most points in a match(except when we score a goal obviously). I think it would add to the atmosphere of the stadium, engage more of the crowd, and in turn motivate the players just that tad bit more. I know this isn‚Äôt totally common in America outside of the NBA(PA saying ‚Äúdefense‚Äù), but I‚Äôd like to think we could always be a little more intimidating as a crowd, and I think this is a good way to start.

I'm certainly not in the ""keep politics out of sports,"" mindset, and I have no issue with a club making a statement if/when they choose,  but I also don't expect the team to have to make its opinion known everytime something controversial happens in politics. That is a lose-lose for the team in many ways. No matter what side you fall on, the team would be alienating fans for their political beliefs one way or the other.

Of coarse, internally, we all know the games will be awesome and fun no matter what the crest is, but from the perspective of someone sitting on their couch that is indifferent to soccer watching the evening news tonight, they aren't going to want to attend games or be a part of this thing and grow the sport or team fan base if we look divided and miserable. Therefore, I propose no booing or negative reactions and let the local soccer community seem united behind the team, regardless of the crest.

3040,94,f7cdrf,"An open dialogue about the ""anthem"".","So, I've had a few thoughts on it since it came out last week. And  I keep landing in the same place. 

It doesn't matter how shitty the song is (it's shitty). 

It doesn't matter that it sounds like one of those altar call songs that crosspoint writes despite the fact that everyone they write is terrible.  

It doesn't matter that it was forced down from corporate overlords.  

I've said it elsewhere but You'll never walk [alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV5_LQArLa0) is a horrible song. Despite that it's one of the most recognized tunes in the world. 

As a Chelsea fan I think [Liquidator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTn01jjEFfY) is an infinitely better walk out song than YNWA, but it by its self played on spotify is a throw away reggae song by a band no one ever remembers. 

Ultimately all that matters is how people decide to treat it a week from tomorrow. If the SGs go after it, and a chunk of the crowd mumbles along it will sound fine, and even potentially sound very good eventually. As noted above the walk out anthem isn't about the song. The crowd makes a bad song more than what it is. 

It there is outright defiance, it'll sound awkward and end up being forced for 4-5 more home matches and depending on the result be canned, or live out the season. Other examples of this include the ""5-1, 5-0"" being played before power plays for a month or so this year, before reverting back to Party Up (what were they thinking). Or, the worst example the ""titan up drum"" that was tried during the 2018 season which was an absolute embarrassment. 

I'm open for counter points here, and i'd like some meaningful discussion. That being said I'm not just looking for complaints. I'd love to hear, regardless of what you think of the song, why the power isn't in our hands (as the fans) to make this thing work. 

I leave you with a few examples of those lame songs I mentioned above sounding absolutely amazing. Anyone who knows how much I despise Liverpool and in particular Jonathan Slape know how hard the first clip was for me to post.

Just so you know, there will be tifo for Memphis on 4/13. We are able to get it printed so a volunteer day for painting will not be necessary. 

BUT, we will need EVERYONE to get in the SS at least 15 minutes prior to the match to help out with this. If you are able to help get there 2 hours before the match to load it into the stadium, that'll be helpful as well, just let me know.

Also, I think this will be the most shade that the club has ever approved us throwing. I normally hate tifo, but I am pretty damn excited for this.

3064,118,bse5ec,Thoughts on never ending crest debate and moving on,"I know that the new crest is not everyone's fancy and that many are more fond of the USL one. That's fine. Personally, I like that it goes in different direction than the USL crest, other MLS and traditional-esque crests, plus the Preds but that's just me. Going in this (modern, if you will) direction has drawn a lot of emotions (negative and positive) but also shown that the crest distinguishes itself from the rest.

Whether it stands out in a good, meh, or bad way is in the eye of the beholder, however, what's most important is the meaning of the crest based on the successes & shortcomings of the club in the years to come. In other words, a logo/crest becomes iconic and meaningful through associated successes and memorable seasons over time, not the other way around. For example, the Preds and ATL United are strong beloved teams with logos that instill pride in fans but had/still have detractors and critics to this day. Likewise, in MLS, Miami and Minnesota can have the most beautiful crests in the league but that means nothing if the teams themselves are bad and fail to win/ inspire.

The fact that there's still discussion over the logo 3 whole months after its unveiling shows how passionate people are for this club and its future. That being said, I've wanted to be over the crest controversy months ago and that we move on but I get it that I'm bias as I'm in the camp that likes the new crest :/ [insert classic Tobias F√ºnke quote]. 

Overall, all this talk and strong emotional reactions one way or the other towards the new crest is better than having widespread apathy across the board which would have been a troubling omen for Nashville SC's future.",Zheguez,2019-05-24 07:59:15

I have no other friends who would be interested at all, so I come here.    


Thank god for the supporter's trust or whoever stopped it.

However, I am disappointed on the whole in the away sections at some of the games. I religiously check /r/MLSAwayFans and I haven't even seen a pic of ours from Saturday. I'm not criticizing those who travel--they're awesome. I am asking how can we get more people to these away games? I am unable to travel currently for specific reasons, but I am wondering if maybe we could put in funds to help buy tickets of those who are interested? If an NSC fans can be in Dallas this Saturday or SLC the next, perhaps supplying their ticket would help increase numbers. 

I know it is hard to make matches in LA and SJ and Denver et al., but I look at Miami have 150+ in Austin and ask why not us? I'm open to discussion on this so please don't take this as criticism. I want to help in any way.",CTIDmississippi,2022-03-09 15:08:58
3070,124,edhoz7,The Nashville Hate,"I know our club isn't perfect, that our FO has made decisions that drew criticism and left many uninspired but the degree of hate our team and city gets on r/mls is bothersome.

It's not a ""sports hatred"" where it could be associated with being a ""top""  team that comes with banter and rivalry. We haven't even kicked a ball in the league. It's gotten to the point that people label our team ""an embarrassment to the league"", that we should never been chosen as an MLS expansion, but go further and trash our city as a whole. 

(Jesus, come on people, give us a chance. Have some banter, sure, but there's no need to drag our home in this or say that fans in our city are any less deserving of a team than others.)

It's not that it's one or two people say this stuff that's bothersome. It's the hundreds that seem to agree with the sentiment.


(It's also crazy how we get so much flak considering that the Austin FC debacle was less than a year ago.)

Regardless, it just dampens the mood every time you see those takes. It likes you finally get to be part of the thing you've wanted for so long only for people to not want you at all. 

Oh well, haters gonna hate, and we'll just keep trucking along.

3071,125,cu0dod,We cannot be satisfied.,"As fans of the growth of soccer in this country and of our hometown team, we cannot be satisfied with two seasons of games at Nissan Stadium. 

I've never seen a sellout game at First Tennessee Park, but I don't have the stats to definitively say there hasn't been one. I know that FTP is not an ideal stadium to watch soccer in, but is it really all that bad? 

We get to enjoy a wonderful neighborhood, with a multitude of bars and restaurants in walking distance. We enjoy a small concourse with plenty of space to roam and watch the game unfold as we wait in line for a beer. FTP is a modern stadium with great features, meant for crowds of our size. 

Nissan is an outdated nightmare. I know management is going to try their best to make it work, but it's not going to. The lower bowl will be at 50% capacity AT BEST, and that is NOT what we want. It's going to look and feel pathetic. The concourse will be a ghost town, and the short lines for food and drink won't be a worthy pay-off.

I know this ship has set sail and it's far too late to change anything. But I am disappointed in our organization with the lack of foresight and care for a growing sport that needs an incubator, not a giant, concrete monstrosity.

A Non-Renewing Season Ticket Holder",jaybyday,2019-08-22 17:09:11

Has there been any scuttlebutt locally about moving the kickoff time of the Vancouver Nashville match on July 30?  I'm sure it's pretty hot during the day in Music City, middle of summer, but I just noticed that WWE Summerslam is on the same day (they've switched some of their shows from the traditional Sunday pay per views) and starts 30 minutes before match time if I've read everything right.  Seems like WWE starts at 630 and Nashville SC kickoff is 700. 

&#x200B;

There might not be the biggest crossover in audiences, but fan or not the WWE event is gonna be a big deal and a big draw.

However, the thing I came here to say, we so desperately need to get back into the East ASAP!!!! The natural developing rivalries we had brewing are to hard to ignore!! Feel like it was a huge mistake and very unfair to move us to the west. if the plan is to eventually move us back, they shoulda made Charlotte bite the bullet for a year in the west, then move them to the east with st. Louis joining the west, and most likely Vegas rounding out the west evenly. Hopefully other fans agree and the one positive takeaway is when we get back to the east the rivalries will be even stronger because of the small hiatus!!

3085,139,ffhyr3,Nashville SC and comparison to Inter Miami,"I have noticed the national coverage from in game commentary and podcasts are linking Inter Miami and us together and inevitably bringing on a comparison between the two clubs performance on the field for the years to come. I'm not on board with this. 

Both teams are taking polar opposite ways of constructing their teams, with Inter going for more of an Atlanta United route of signing big up and coming talents from South America whereas we are kind of doing an approach more along the lines of FC Cincy taking on experienced MLS players that have proven themselves in the league. With that being said, we have made some international splashes with Hany and Leal, and i expect one more adding a DP forward midseason. Also, I think it is fair to note that we are playing in a much stronger Western conference and Miami is playing in a more wide open Eastern.

I know since both expansion sides started in MLS the same year, there is a natural link between the two sides, kind of like Minnesota and Atlanta. However, I think we shouldn't get discouraged if Miami comes out of the gates hot this first season and winds up more well off in the standing at the end of the year.

He is [averaging less than a shot per game](https://www.whoscored.com/Players/315274/Show/Alex-Muyl) (0.9) , 0.6 key passes per 90 minutes, and is dispossessed more than any other player on the roster (1.7 times per match).

3149,203,b93f9a,"Suggestion: ""Villains"" as Unofficial Secondary Nickname","Hey folks long time, no reddit (not counting my post on Monday). Cool to see how things have grown around here.

Anyway, with ""The Boys in Gold"" being established as an official nickname, I wonder what you think about ‚ÄúVillains‚Äù being an unofficial secondary nickname for the team? Now, hear me out, I do not have a problem with ‚ÄúThe Boys in Gold‚Äù or want to see it replaced. I want to suggest a second name that could be used more casually and offer even a bit more personality to our club.

Here are the reasons I came up:

* It‚Äôs a nickname that‚Äôs more akin to American sports naming structure so might be easier for fanbase to relate to/identify with
* similar in vein to the Titans and Predators so fits in
* ‚ÄúBoys in Gold‚Äù on its own can be confusing due to the Preds
* ‚ÄúVillains‚Äù has been tried as a nickname for the club before over the years so it wouldn‚Äôt be coming out of nowhere
* plays on Nashvillians, so it‚Äôd be easy for people to get it and connects with town identity
* leans in to the fact that they‚Äôre already a number of clubs that don‚Äôt like us but that‚Äôs not stopping us and we embrace it (even our club's twitter account is starting to get spicier)
* Identifies team in a way beyond our color
* juxtaposes well with nicer ‚ÄúBoys in Gold‚Äù
* It‚Äôs a cool name to refer to the team casually",Zheguez,2019-04-03 20:41:57

3203,257,at3s4m,Morning after: the ‚Äòglass half-full‚Äô take on our new crest,"Gonna try and be optimistic here since I‚Äôm 99.9% sure the club isn‚Äôt going to consider a redesign at this point. While at first glance, my reaction was heavy disapproval, it‚Äôs also very rare to get a positive initial response when rolling out an entirely new brand ‚Äî especially when going for a more simple look like this one. A club‚Äôs brand has a lot more to do with its reputation, history, and *what* it does rather than the actual design of its logo. Imagine the reaction if the Green Bay Packers or University of Miami were starting today and they introduced their current logos. It would be terrible, yet both logos are widely recognized among the best in sports. I went with those two examples, but you can fill in the blank with whoever you‚Äôd like. I have a sense of respect and admiration when seeing Atlanta United‚Äôs crest not because of its design, but because of the club‚Äôs success both on the field and in the stands. In fact, I personally thought their logo was generic and underwhelming when it was released as well. So at the end of the day, regardless of how it looks, this crest will stand for whatever we make it stand for (and that‚Äôs exciting ‚Äî we get to start with an entirely clean palette and reputation). 

This crest will grow on everyone as the club creates and grows it‚Äôs own brand, which was basically just established yesterday. The question is just *how much* it will grow on us. What we do know is that the logo is slick, stands out, and should make for some overall cohesiveness in the club‚Äôs brand. Is it shaped like a road sign? Yeah maybe, but its the *only* crest shaped like a road sign, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's not a circle or shield like every other crest in MLS. It's unique, and that will make it all but more distinguished and recognizable as time goes by. The simplicity (which I will take over a cluttered logo 10 times out of 10 -- looking at you, Titans) somewhat reminds me of a slightly modern take on the crests of Dortmund, Monchengladbach, and Juventus (all of which would probably get similar initial reactions if introduced today ‚Äî we, of course, know the Juventus crest did). 

I‚Äôm still not sure what my verdict is, and I certainly have my questions about the shades of blue (purple?) and yellow, but I‚Äôll hold my judgement for now and wait to see what the club does with its brand over time. Either way, I‚Äôm freaking pumped for MLS In Nashville. I hate seeing the current disunity and lack of excitement within the supporters right now. I really hope this will all be forgotten in a few months so we can focus on doing our part of the equation: creating a distinctive and successful fan base.

2. Unbeaten streak at home snapped by the worst team in the league.
3. Worst loss since Nashville has been in the MLS (4-1) against Charlotte.
4. Way to many draws that should‚Äôve been wins. I understand taking a draw when coming from behind or against a better team, but to get one goal and then sit on it and inviting pressure is dumb.

We saw a glimpse of this at Nissan with the light rigs up and down the section and the fog machines.       
          
Now it's my opinion as an individual supporter that the name of the section literally doesn't matter because it has zero impact on the individual supporter groups or how they brand themselves. SKC calls their section ""The Cauldron"" and it takes a trip down the google rabbit hole to figure that one out if you're a new fan. However some clubs (Minnesota with ""Wonderwall"" or LAFC with ""The 3252"" for instance)) have nailed something that has become a bit of a marketing goldmine.

That is in no way Mukhtar's fault but I think we need more variety in set pieces, both for improving defending against them during practice and an added arrow in our quiver during games.

3263,317,szt2ck,Preseason hype frustrations,"I have been going on a slight rant about NSC and some of the decisions made, especially in the preseason. 

This is going to be a tough season (ESPECIALLY with the first 8 games on the road). Why did we not play any open preseason games? Other teams are doing that and allowing fans in‚Ä¶

 I Just think it would‚Äôve been smart for NSC to give the fans some excitement before we watch from afar for 8 weeks. The die hard fans will be in it and watching, but they will struggle to keep new fans‚Äô attention, especially if we don‚Äôt win these tough away games. A fun, family preseason game with a meet and greet and some free NSC swag (with the new shirt on sale) would‚Äôve been amazing. 

Or they could‚Äôve played a USL team nearby and gained some fans‚Ä¶ I saw Atlanta play in Birmingham, Alabama- which was also a chance for them to gain fans who don‚Äôt have an MLS team in their own city.

Instead, they didn‚Äôt make a stream available and didn‚Äôt even tell us who scored vs Philadelphia. It‚Äôs just strange in my opinion‚Ä¶

Anyway, excited for the season and the new stadium. Just wish they capitalized on the momentum from last season‚Ä¶",umlungudude,2022-02-23 21:51:30

Through all of the Supporters/Roadies discussion on here last month, one thing I wanted to do is start some new Roadies chapters in different locations.  While working on trying to be more welcoming to everyone , we want to be welcoming to anyone, anywhere in the state of Tennessee and beyond.  


With that being said, do you live in Murfreesboro, and are you looking for a spot to watch Nashville SC away matches/talk soccer with like minded people? Well you are in luck!! All away matches will be on at Party Fowl in Murfreesboro for the season!  


Follow them on social media @boroadies on twitter.  


Also, does your city need some Nashville Soccer love? Let us know, as we want this idea of including everyone in Tennessee to spread, and would love to have more city chapters around.

I don't think this happens until July or August at the earliest. I could envision a shortened season of around 20 games or so. I have seen the idea of playing in empty stadiums thrown around, but is this feasible for a league like MLS? There isn't a lot of TV revenue and clubs rely so much on ""butts in the seats"" for revenue. The problem then becomes the playoffs. In order to have as many regular season games as possible, I would not be surprised if the playoffs are drastically shortened. Possibly even just having the champions of both conferences play each other in a 2 leg series for all the marbles. In this scenario, you could have a regular season run into late November and maximize games (and revenue) for all clubs.",Snarky-TaunTaun,2020-04-20 16:24:36

As a member of First String, I was offered the opportunity to purchase playoff tickets before the general public.  I purchased for and attended the first playoff game (great night; very nice), but I'm either illiterate or the website doesn't clearly explain things.

I have a balance of close to $270. But the account manager won't let me pay it.  And I tried paying the full amount once tickets for playoffs were available.

Is anyone else seeing a balance to be payed? And can that balance be explained with the prospect of future playoff matches here?

I'm interested in learning more about your team as you enter the MLS. Specifically by watching replays on ESPN plus and gathering a better understanding of the club. Are there any particular players that I should look out for? How do you feel about Gary Smith? What formation do you guys typically use, and what's the story with the great defense in the league?

I'll be watching what I can to solve these for myself but I'd love to ask you all as well, since who knows the team better than it's fans? ;)

If you‚Äôre on the fence about any group I say attended their pregame events or away game watch parties.  We will be having tailgates outdoors when the weather works in our favor again.  We have Music City Light as a partner this year to supply us beer and we will try to have food available for the Saturday matches.  We try to be welcoming to all and even away supporters.  When we pulled out of Von Elrods and to the lot at the old steakhouse things felt imeditally better.  

When the group got going with me, Graeme, Brad and Mauricio (who was here for about a year before moving back to Chicago) we talked about one of the big issues with the club and that‚Äôs bringing in more of the immigrant community.  That‚Äôs been expressed towards the club and hope that‚Äôs something they can improve on.  With our current board that‚Äôs something we‚Äôve continued to discuss.  

Our VP Steve said it best in our vision ‚ÄúWe are The Assembly, a dedicated group of supporters of NSC who strive to include all, allow fans to be themselves, and create a passionate unscripted game day atmosphere. We want you to be you!‚Äù   

We aren‚Äôt perfect but I always ask for input from members on ideas we can throw around.  It‚Äôs not easy running an SG but I‚Äôm feeling a lot better this year with our board and new partnership opportunities.  We are far from the size I want to be and me as well as the board will continue to work to grow.  

On March 9th feel free to spot by our pregame even if you are a member of another SG.  We should have an event posted early next week with details.

3499,553,86rkwa,Newbie here looking for some info about the game tomorrow. Please don't upvote.,"Hello, I purchased four tickets to the game tomorrow. I'm thinking about season tickets. I've never followed American professional soccer and am trying to figure it all out. 

Why is the game tomorrow the ""inaugural game"" if the Nashville SC has played games this season already in First Tennessee Stadium and played previous season in TN?

What is the USL? I thought they were an MLS team now? If they aren't an MLS team when are they becoming one? Is it like the Premier League where there are lower leagues an expansion teams have to climb up into the MLS from the USL?

I read on the Nashville SC website that Nashville SC ""hosted"" the Atlanta United FC in February. If Nashville is in the USL and not the MLS how could they have hosted Atlanta? If tomorrow is their inaugural game then did they not play a game against Atlanta because that would have been their inaugural game this season, right? Or did they not play against Atlanta United FC and literally just let them play a game in First Tennessee Stadium against a different MLS team? Or was that a preseason match? But why would a USL team play a preseason match against an MLS team?

As you can see, I'm pretty confused. Any clarification would be great! Thanks!",AirweePahuh,2018-03-24 07:20:15

* Is there a meaningful difference in others perception of authentic vs replica? Like what would fit in better for watching
* Any guidelines on what is acceptable to wear to what events?
* There's a lot of jersey colors. Is there any decorum on what to wear? What's the preferred colors? Is it possible to wear one color to a different kit game or is that tacky?
* Is it poser to get a jersey? I don't know the team 100% yet but I'm all in.
* **How does customization work on the in store bought (like process)?**
* **How does customization work on jerseys bought elsewhere (dicks, authority sports, ebay)? Is it even possible?**

It's only occurred to me this week that the MLS season is during everyone else's (read UK & Europe's) football league off-season, so is MLS losing players to the Euros?  When the World Cup comes around will MLS play a shortened season, or does it not have an impact because the decent USA men's players aren't playing MLS?

3683,737,jet79d,NAFMO: Online FIFA 21 MLS League Looking for Nashville SC Manager," 

Hey there! We're entering the second season in an MLS-based online FIFA 21 league and we're looking for someone to manage/play as Nashville SC. We've got a strong community of MLS fans who are managing their favorite teams and we'd love to have a true supporter take control of Nashville.

**More info about the NAFMO league:**

At the beginning of this year, I created a full-featured online manager mode ran through FIFA 21, Discord, and Google Docs. Since EA has yet to introduce an online manager mode to play with friends, I took the concept into my own hands and created something based on a prior league I was in. With that said, I created this league on the basis of fair play, integrity, and equal say. This means that league decisions will be voted on by the league; every team gets a vote. I want to run this thing as a democracy, not as a dictatorship.

The league features a full-fledged team management system, complete with financials, wages, scouting, transfers, academies/USL affiliates, auctions, and much, much more. Weekly and biweekly matchups will be home-and-home fixtures, where you'll play your opponent twice. There will be a great mix of realistic gameplay with a great community and the manager/career mode that we all love in FIFA (except for EA, of course). Stats will be tracked, games will be streamed, and rivalries will be formed. In addition to this, I will be hosting a weekly NAFMO matchweek recap on Sunday evenings that will show highlights, discuss questions/comments, hint towards the upcoming week's auction player(s), and more!

The first season of NAFMO has been a wonderful success; a season where we were able to smooth out the edges and implement new ideas and concepts for the upcoming second season. With \~18 members currently, we're excited to find more members!

We're looking to make the games as realistic as possible. This means that overuse of skill-moves will be frowned upon in the league; if that upsets you, just stick to ultimate team. In addition to this, our league settings will feature other in-game settings that will make the game more realistic and challenging. Pretty standard stuff, though; nothing crazy.

As of now, we'll be playing FIFA 21 on Xbox One.

Requirements:

* Xbox One w/ FIFA 21
* Discord
* Ability to stream every game on Twitch.tv (all games will be hosted at twitch.tv/NAFMO)
* Internet that will not result in lag

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask! A ton more details can be found in the Discord if you're interested in joining. Due to the nature of this concept, being involved in this league could be a little time-consuming. With that said, I want to work with members to find the right pace for everyone.

Thank you! I'm really excited to build this thing out even more! Let me know if you're interested in joining and I'll send you the Discord link in a PM!",PDXDarby,2020-10-20 16:38:22

The first one was not supposed to be a shot on goal right?) but somehow found its way in the back of the net. The second was just abysmal goalkeeping. I'm still not sure what to think of that miss at the beginning of the game. Now I know that there were some factors to explain the poor showing on offense (it being the first game, poor playing conditions, new opponent with little to no scouting report), but I don't think those are that valid of excuses.

And I get the multiple complaints of manager mismanagement.. but our stars are also lacking lately. Hany blew multiple great opportunities last night including a shot off the cross bar that he makes 90% of the time. Walker Zimmerman sent a wide open opportunity to the 26th row as well.

3836,890,gz5kvx,How would you feel if some players with small children or at-risk family members did not play in Orlando?,"The new Orlando tournament was slightly modified last week to make it easier on the players.  Instead of leaving their families for 2 months, it's down to 6 weeks.  And instead of it being a relatively inconsequential tournament, word is that the winning team now gets an automatic bid for the Champions League.  Still not an easy decision to leave your family during a pandemic and a recession, even if you badly want to play.  

For example, Diego Valeri's wife is pregnant and there's no way he plays.  Who knows what Portland looks like without him?  (NSC wouldn't have 2 losses that's for sure)  Dax has kids I think, maybe under one year old.  That would be a tough call, personally.  Two games in, I think he is the heart and soul of our team and the midfield would be totally different without him.  I desperately want to see him play (I think it's the only way the team has a chance to hold their own), but wouldn't blame him for staying home.

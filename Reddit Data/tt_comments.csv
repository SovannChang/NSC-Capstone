65,fd90sud,fd8yk6n,"If the receiving team doesn‚Äôt touch it (usually it‚Äôs the returner leaving it go back for a touch back) then the kicking team can down the ball before the end zone and the receiving team gets the ball at that spot, which is what happened last night. If a player for the returning team touches the ball then the kicking team can try to recover it and run it in for a touchdown or just get possession of the ball.

128,fd75fcv,fd72js1,"Just think about the story here. 

Two Men. 

Two Memes 

Two Ryans. 


Ryan Fitzpatrick 

The leagues greatest Journeyman QB and the Patriots regular season killer. He quietly assembled the wins against the pats. The Bills, The Jets, and Finally the Dolphins, quietly Destroying the Horcruxes. 
 He weakens the Patriots for the Frodo of our story, the harry, the Luke, the Tony Stark. 


That man is Ryan Tannehill 

Forged in the fire of hell (Miami). The dolphins tore at the psyche of the great Ryan Tannehill. They tried to break him knowing that when they finally killed the man, the meme would be reborn. They then sent the fruits of their labour to a Viable team. The Miami Dolphins haven't been tanking for a decade now, that was all a cover. They've been quietly assembling this great man. 

Every great man needs a weapon, and Ryan Tannehill, much like Arthur pulling Excalibur from the stone, pulls Derrick Henry from the curse that is 7-9 with no playoff birth and wields him masterfully. 

The Evil is vanquished.

You start the game with 70% Murray 30% Henry so you have some ground and pound, and some flexibility with Murray out of the backfield and in protection, keeping Henry's leg more fresh, then in the 3rd you switch it to 70/30 Tractor so Henry starts hammering a more tired defense while still forcing them to watch out for Murray's hands and open field ability.

The Music City Miracle is a legendary American football play that took place on January 8, 2000 during the National Football League (NFL)'s 1999‚Äì2000 playoffs. It occurred at the end of the Wild-Card playoff game between the Tennessee Titans and Buffalo Bills at Adelphia Coliseum, now known as Nissan Stadium, in Nashville, Tennessee. After the Bills had taken a 16‚Äì15 lead on a field goal with 16 seconds remaining in the game, Titans tight end Frank Wycheck threw a lateral pass across the field to Kevin Dyson on the ensuing kickoff return, and Dyson then ran 75 yards to score the winning touchdown and earn a 22‚Äì16 victory.

consecutive unsuccessful drives when he was still in the game (plus, KC went ride down the field to get a last second TD before the end of the half without Kelce).  

The offense changed things up, and their opening 9-minute 2nd half drive gave this defense even more time to get ready.  This defense definitely stepped it up in the 2nd half.  Give the credit when its due.",NerfHerder_91,2018-01-07 00:57:59,7onc6x

I wasn't wrong, and I am glad it was just a concussion that Kelce was able to get up and walk from (none of that Zach Miller stuff yikes).

We sent 

3 teams to the conference championship(Could be 4 with a texans win).

4 teams that reached divisional playoffs

3 wild cards.

10-7 Record



In comparison AFC N in the same timespan:

1 team to conference championship

4 to divisional playoffs(with 2 teams going one and done after getting a first round bye).

3 Wild Cards

4-9


AFC W:
1 SB Champ
1 Conference Championship appearance 
7 divisonal playoffs(2 teams going one and done)
5-6

The only conference that might have a better playoff record the past 5 years is AFC E, but it‚Äôs solely due to Patriots dominating and the other teams being bottom feeders. Other than Patriots always having top 2 seed, they sent 3 WCs and they all went one and done.

Yet when you see the post ranking which division are more competitive, AFCS is always in the bottom. Because we don‚Äôt get respect despite being by far the most competitive division in the past 5 years. 

I‚Äôm hoping for a Texans x Titans AFCCG, and whoever wins win the SB. I‚Äôm tired of always being the guys that supposed(have the easiest path to playoffs when we have the hardest). Sure we dont put 12+ win teams in the playoffs. But our 9-11 wins teams are as good as any other team in the league(except the Patriots).

i've made that exact same post in many victory post-game threads in the past, but this time it feels better to post than all the other times combined. friends, this is the sweetest hooty hoo i've ever had. titan the fuck up baby!

i've been posting on this subreddit since 2012 when there was literally nobody around here, and there were absolutely no memes. it's been a long time since then, filled with so much shitty football that we all suffered through, but that just makes this playoff run even more incredible. on so many sundays through these years i've been stuck in a corner at the back of a bar because that's the only tv they'd put the titans game on. the reputation the titans have gained over the years for being as mediocre as possible actually was beneficial for some of those years, because at times the titans were not even close to being mediocre, having to watch all those games from 2012-2015 was physically painful.

thankfully it became at least more bearable to watch this team in 2016, when finally there was some competency. instead watching this team became purely frustrating instead of painfully shitty. it's been remarkable to see this team become an unpredictable enigma that could beat any team in the league, but also lose to any team in the league. 

but finally, this team has fulfilled that potential we all knew they had of competing with the best of the best in the nfl. they just finally started winning the games they should win, which allowed them to get into the playoffs and prove just how great they could be. my favorite part about this team is how they're not afraid of anyone. they went into foxborough and ended the greatest dynasty we've ever seen. they went into baltimore and beat a team that looked like they were in an entirely different league than anyone else. they don't just think they can beat anyone, they know they can, and they play like it.",Bieber_hole_69,2020-01-12 04:24:10,eniqty

No disrespect to the titans, I'm a firm believer that Tennessee beating them is a huge fluke and robs the Ravens of truly accomplishing what their capable of. I've spent the last few minutes in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire regular season watching the Ravens play great football it's just not fair.

If the Ravens lose again I will face that the Titans deserved the win, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the Ravens and the NFL

3050,j3ogsm0,j3o7ijh,"Here's my thoughts about hanging onto Downing for one more year.

&#x200B;

Last year, as miserable as we were on offense, we were still borderline average. That was with a, at the time, historic amount of injuries that we were plagued with, including Henry being out for the season. There was an argument to be made that the offense was capable of producing better results if luck was on our side.

Vrabel made the wrong choice this past offseason, clearly, but I think giving coordinators the benefit of the doubt pays dividends in the long term. It makes the Titans a more attractive option for up & coming coordinators, because they know that they'll be given a chance to correct things.

I'm glad that we don't have to spend another season watching that miserable offense, but I understand why Vrabel went the direction he did with this past season. Sometimes things don't work out, and while it's easy to fault someone for making the wrong choice, there usually is a rationale behind that choice. I think Vrabel will make the right choice moving forward, however.",balzynalzy,2023-01-09 23:47:52,107rjil

With your best defensive player essentially playing on one leg half the year. Without two of your best pass rushers for the majority of the year. 

They were pretty much the reason we got close to winning anything this year. Again if the offense isn‚Äôt led by Captain Nemo buried 20,000 leagues under the sea, this team probably wins 3-4 more games WITH all the problems the defense had.

We could not stop him. They bled out the clock and there was nothing we could do about it. The Titans vaunted run defense looked like clown shoes.

Also -- I certainly don't hate the ""go for it"" 4th down call for us to try to go ahead 3 points, but it's on Vrabel for not taking a time out after the pre-snap motion looked totally busted. And if what we ran was the called play, then it was a bad play call from the jump anyway.

We're half in and half out, once again. If we want to give one last shot to the Tanney/Henry combo, then just go all out and take a huge swing and we'll deal with the fallout later. If we've identified the vets aren't good enough to make contention realistic, let's trade assets while they still have value and you absolutely HAVE to play the young QBs so you can gauge if you have a guy or if you still need to be looking. 

But what we're doing is quintessentially half-measures.

This whole season is going to be a weird one, we'll win some games we shouldn't and lose some other ones we should win, but I don't think we make the playoffs or compete for anything this year. I don't want to beat the dead horse of how this is all JRob's fault, but this is what happens when you whiff on at least 2 drafts in a row and trade away your best player, there are just too many holes on this roster for it to be fixed in one offseason.

* **Better than expected:** the O-line did okay. We can say they didn't lose the game, at least. They still need help, and that help would better serve down the field to catch passes. But the O-line has to get better at being on their own. They certainly need to get better at run blocking.

* **Fulton sucks:** maybe he _was_ good, and maybe he does have athletic ability, but I can name a few guys like that from the Ruston Webster era that didn't amount to anything.

1. We aren't winning anything important this year. It's just not happening. We may rip off a few wins, but we aren't going to be able to keep up with the blue chips.

2. Our o-line is still shaky AF, and from what I can tell, RT can't handle the pressure.

3. Stroud and Richardson are starting for their teams, and they're getting better every week. Meanwhile, our future is sitting on the bench, missing out on very valuable reps. By the time the team decides to move on from RT, whichever QB we start is going to be playing catchup to the 3 other young QBs in our division.

Something has to change offensively. We can't keep scoring less than 17 points and expect to win anything of note. The defense has good games and bad games. More good than bad.

Defense was brutal, but sometimes you have to tip your cap to the other team‚Äôs play caller. The Colts knew Fulton‚Äôs tendencies and exposed them over and over, and obviously they found a soft spot scheme wise in our run defense that no one else has in awhile

99,k44rrti,,"It wasn't that bad of a game, really.

Our offence was a bit one-dimensional but still functional. If things had bounced our way in the redzone, we could have came away with TDs instead of FGs and won the game pretty handily. I'm pleased with how the offensive line seems to be developing--it'll obviously have issues with elite pass rushes like the Browns, but they're on their way to being solidly mediocre against most opponents, which is definitely better than I expected them to be before the season. 

Offensive playcalling was interesting. It was great to see Hopkins have a big game. With the exception of the attempted Henry TD pass, though, it seemed much less inventive than what we saw last week, and that's how we managed to get our other receivers involved. I feel like they come out and do something quite different each game. That's probably a good thing, but it'd be nice if they could change things up when it's clear that their plan isn't quite working as well as they'd hoped.

Our defence was worrying. I'm not too surprised that our secondary gave up big plays, but I'm disappointed that our pash rush wasn't able to affect the game more. They seem *good*, but that isn't always amounting to sacks or turnovers. And the loss of Tart obviously hurt our run defence immensely--no wonder he wants to get paid. But they more or less managed to keep us in the game right until the very end, so it's hard to be too mad. (Obviously there were some infuriating specific issues, but those have been discussed in detail by this point. I will just say that I think Fulton was a wee bit unlucky to be called for *both* pass interferences. Not that they were bad calls as such, but the second one at least was borderline, and could easily have been missed).

I had pretty low expectations coming into this season and am just glad to see us play in competitive games (yes, the Browns game was a fucking disaster, but we've otherwise looked at least solidly *okay*). I know it's disappointing to accept mediocrity, but I've kind of reconciled myself to that just being where we are as a team right now. So I'm enjoying the highs, like our fun, close victory over the Chargers and our domination of the Bengals, and doing my best not to get too worked up about the losses.

Feels like the year before we brought in Vrabel, Malcom Butler, Logan Ryan et al and really started to make noise.

That said, yesterday was a winnable game and we didn't make the plays to win it. We punted once on like 7 drives and scored 16 points. It's inexcusable.

I'd say my biggest frustration is our over commitment to Henry in big Downs like the 4th down. I know he's an amazing player, but every team is willing to lose ANY WAY other than at the hands of Henry.

Case in point, we scored in four plays on the one drive Henry basically never got the ball.

I want to see the Titans come out and literally just play action pass so frequently that the defense has to give up on the stop Henry plan. So many times we just dunk on people play after play and then decide we have to stop doing what's working so Henry can get his touches and it fucks us EVERY TIME.

When we played the Pats in '19 Bill lined up in two high shell the whole game to take away the explosive passes. He essentially gave Henry 200+ yards and STILL only allowed 14 points to the offense.

The more teams fear the pass the better off Henry will be, and they refuse to fear it and we refuse to punish them for it *consistently*. That is by far my biggest frustration.",iMixMusicOnTwitch,2023-10-09 14:35:54,173sand

+DeAndre Hopkins. Dude‚Äôs still got it. People were seriously overthinking what he could do and the Titans past reputation to watch him have more yards than Derrick Henry.

+Nick Folk. No worries about him drilling field goals at all

+Andre Dillard wasn‚Äôt completely terrible yesterday. Heck, pass protection wasn‚Äôt bad allowing only one sack.

+Tyjae Spears was an absolute gem in the late 3rd, scoring our only TD on the road.

Now for the negatives.

-Run defense. Teair Tart‚Äôs paycheck just got a lot larger today. Zach Moss kept running up the gut for at least 4 yards, and our linebackers couldn‚Äôt do anything. He accounted for Indy‚Äôs two touchdowns yesterday, so if we were as good as we‚Äôve been over the last few seasons, we likely win that game. I don‚Äôt want to hear a fucking word about how it‚Äôs meaningless or useless to have a great run defense *ever again*. You lost that right with our first loss at Lucas Oil in five seasons.

-On that note, the pass rush looked awful today. Two QB hits and only one sack (hello, Mr. McCreary). If the front 7 doesn‚Äôt click, we don‚Äôt have any defense to speak of and we lose because of...

-The secondary. Fourth straight game without an interception, one pass deflection. Byard‚Äôs been simply a guy that makes tackles instead of someone that‚Äôs making plays like he used to. McCreary‚Äôs been a good slot corner, and SMB‚Äôs been nice, but that‚Äôs about it for the secondary. Don‚Äôt even get me started on‚Ä¶

-Kristian Fulton. He had the aforementioned pass deflection, but overall, he‚Äôs a useless dumbass that gets his lunch eaten on basic double moves and leads the NFL in DPI flags. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather play Avery or Farley in his spot knowing damn well that they likely won‚Äôt be better, but at least we‚Äôll have clarity on letting them walk.

-Redzone offense. What the hell‚Äôs going on here? Seriously, that was the one aspect of offense that clicked even if we‚Äôd hardly get there. Now, our offense is excellent at edging before failing to deliver the final payout.

-Run game. Seriously, Derrick Henry looks mediocre. Slow, unable to evade tackles, overwhelmed in the backfield. Run blocking and Colts linebacker and interior be damned, Tyjae‚Äôs done more with the same. 

-Receivers. We had D-Hop, but that‚Äôs it, only NWI caught a pass. Okonkwo needs to hit the Jugs machine with all the drops he‚Äôs had this season. Just a very uneven performance overall

-This wasn‚Äôt just our first loss at Lucas Oil in the post-Luck era, it was our only divisional game before mid-November. Almost every single prediction that had us making the playoffs depended on us winning this game.

135,k454syl,,"First of all, we didn't look like total crap even in a loss. Which is refreshing honestly üò¨

Offense wise, our playcalling had issues (especially 4th and 1 call), but otherwise it is vastly improved from last year. Guys are being schemed open, and whenever the broadcast cuts to Kelly, he actually looks like he knows what the fuck he's doing. Like seriously, I feel like obviously our offense is better than last year, but in many ways it's better than when we had ABJ. And by that I mean in terms of better playcalling, playing to our strengths mostly. Even in 2019, we were often relying on our individual elite players to make plays, rather than effectively setting them up to make those plays. It worked because they were elite, but a lot of times it looked messy, and could be shut down by an elite team, which happened often in the playoffs. 

Look, Kelly is not Andy Reid or Shanahan, but I'm so happy with what I've seen from him so far. A massive breath of fresh air. I think our main issues yesterday were poor OL play, especially run blocking, and lacking a downfield threat like Burks to stretch the field. Hopefully both can improve as the season goes on. DHop looked INCREDIBLE yesterday I must say, truly can catch anything remotely near him. He is aging like wine.

Defense wise, yesterday was not their day. They got bullied up and down the field. Fulton is not it, and we missed Tart. I suspect the Colts OL has greatly improved. I don't know exactly how they could improve the rest of the season beyond hoping yesterday was just a down day though. It's not so much a lack of experience or figuring out a new scheme, more like we lack talent in a few key areas. But yeah, hopefully we get Tart back soon",Gand-Elf,2023-10-09 15:33:53,173sand

148,k45avml,,"Big money players not making an impact: Jeffrey Simmons (ranked 8th on the defense), Harold Landry (24th on the defense),

Young players that need to make more of an impact: Chig, Burks, Fulton (all three have been tremendously disappointing.)

Tannehill is on this list as well, but he's picked it up lately. Both Simmons and Landry have become one dimensional pass rushers and aren't as good at their other fits (Simmons with the run game and Landry with coverage) and both need to play better or their contracts will become a handcuff. (We can't be paying 48M for the 36th ranked interior defender. We are supposed to have one of the best interiors in the league.)

But yeah, these 5 guys have been contributing the most to the shitty start to the season. Simmons, Landry, Chig, Burks, and Fulton. PFF identifies them as performing even worse than the depth level guys aside from Simmons who has performed thus far this season like a borderline starter in the NFL. Some of them have grades below 50. The highest grade amongst these players are 60. Our role players (guys like Gibbens, NWI etc) have been performing in their role like a playoff team would, but the guys we need to take us there largely have not done their job.

All of them have underperformed relative to their expectations. Simmons is safe but there may be a trade in the near future with one of Henry/Landry. I think Henry is a rough fit in this current offense and the direction of the team indicates to me that they might be moving on from the veterans based on how they've played thus far. 2-4 at the bye, it might be time to try and get some draft picks for Henry/Tannehill and let the kids roll the rest of the way and see what happens.  Burks and Chig have to play better or the direction of the team will change for them. Burks is safer than Chig. We're already seeing more Josh Whyle than anticipated and with every holding call and OPI, Chig is in danger of losing his job to the kid.

Nothing Vrabel can do when 7 of your highest paid guys are underperforming relative to the expectations. The coaching has been there and we've been in every game *except one* but the depth guys can't carry when the big dogs lose their matchups.",BurzyGuerrero,2023-10-09 16:10:15,173sand
149,k45df22,,"1. We are an example of roster building and philosophy going in opposite directions. JRob got so busy trying to play Jedi mind tricks he forgot what he was trying to build, which was the biggest, meanest, physical football team in the league. He started there, a lot of his picks early were guys who had performed extremely well in college, but had been underrated for one reason or another. By the end he was trying to play to his own ego pushing around AJ, and focusing entirely on finding the diamonds in the tough, not necessarily guys who had been eminently productive in college. We are now, small, slow, and without the big meanies we need to put physical other teams. Need to either abandon the vrabel philosophy (and probably vrabel himself), and build the light fast team, or go back to getting the large imposing guys. 


2. Kelly impressed me yesterday for the most part. He is figuring it out. His RZ play calling was absolutely atrocious, but I'm loving the varied formations, way he is using guys in different ways, etc. 


3. Chig is not as good as we thought. Not saying he's a bust, but we probably should have grabbed Darnell Washington despite his lack of production in Pitt. At least he can block and is a true red zone threat. Chig is too small to be a true leaper/high point RZ TE, his hands are inconsistent, and he isn't a great blocker. 


4. I've been ready to move on from Tanny since week 1. He's not as bad as I thought, but his arm clearly isn't what it once was and his mechanics look really different from past seasons. Not sure if he can't grip the ball right anymore, or if he just can't get the zip, but something is really off. I'm also by no means a hater, I have defended him in years past and love what he has brought to this team. But I'm ready to ship him off for whatever draft picks we can get and see what we have for the future.

* **Better than expected:** the O-line did okay. We can say they didn't lose the game, at least. They still need help, and that help would better serve down the field to catch passes. But the O-line has to get better at being on their own. They certainly need to get better at run blocking.

2. Our o-line is still shaky AF, and from what I can tell, RT can't handle the pressure.

3. Stroud and Richardson are starting for their teams, and they're getting better every week. Meanwhile, our future is sitting on the bench, missing out on very valuable reps. By the time the team decides to move on from RT, whichever QB we start is going to be playing catchup to the 3 other young QBs in our division.

Something has to change offensively. We can't keep scoring less than 17 points and expect to win anything of note. The defense has good games and bad games. More good than bad.

Defense was brutal, but sometimes you have to tip your cap to the other team‚Äôs play caller. The Colts knew Fulton‚Äôs tendencies and exposed them over and over, and obviously they found a soft spot scheme wise in our run defense that no one else has in awhile

Our offence was a bit one-dimensional but still functional. If things had bounced our way in the redzone, we could have came away with TDs instead of FGs and won the game pretty handily. I'm pleased with how the offensive line seems to be developing--it'll obviously have issues with elite pass rushes like the Browns, but they're on their way to being solidly mediocre against most opponents, which is definitely better than I expected them to be before the season. 

Offensive playcalling was interesting. It was great to see Hopkins have a big game. With the exception of the attempted Henry TD pass, though, it seemed much less inventive than what we saw last week, and that's how we managed to get our other receivers involved. I feel like they come out and do something quite different each game. That's probably a good thing, but it'd be nice if they could change things up when it's clear that their plan isn't quite working as well as they'd hoped.

Our defence was worrying. I'm not too surprised that our secondary gave up big plays, but I'm disappointed that our pash rush wasn't able to affect the game more. They seem *good*, but that isn't always amounting to sacks or turnovers. And the loss of Tart obviously hurt our run defence immensely--no wonder he wants to get paid. But they more or less managed to keep us in the game right until the very end, so it's hard to be too mad. (Obviously there were some infuriating specific issues, but those have been discussed in detail by this point. I will just say that I think Fulton was a wee bit unlucky to be called for *both* pass interferences. Not that they were bad calls as such, but the second one at least was borderline, and could easily have been missed).

I had pretty low expectations coming into this season and am just glad to see us play in competitive games (yes, the Browns game was a fucking disaster, but we've otherwise looked at least solidly *okay*). I know it's disappointing to accept mediocrity, but I've kind of reconciled myself to that just being where we are as a team right now.

Feels like the year before we brought in Vrabel, Malcom Butler, Logan Ryan et al and really started to make noise.

That said, yesterday was a winnable game and we didn't make the plays to win it. We punted once on like 7 drives and scored 16 points. It's inexcusable.

I'd say my biggest frustration is our over commitment to Henry in big Downs like the 4th down. I know he's an amazing player, but every team is willing to lose ANY WAY other than at the hands of Henry.

Case in point, we scored in four plays on the one drive Henry basically never got the ball.

I want to see the Titans come out and literally just play action pass so frequently that the defense has to give up on the stop Henry plan. So many times we just dunk on people play after play and then decide we have to stop doing what's working so Henry can get his touches and it fucks us EVERY TIME.

When we played the Pats in '19 Bill lined up in two high shell the whole game to take away the explosive passes. He essentially gave Henry 200+ yards and STILL only allowed 14 points to the offense.

+DeAndre Hopkins. Dude‚Äôs still got it. People were seriously overthinking what he could do and the Titans past reputation to watch him have more yards than Derrick Henry.

+Nick Folk. No worries about him drilling field goals at all

+Andre Dillard wasn‚Äôt completely terrible yesterday. Heck, pass protection wasn‚Äôt bad allowing only one sack.

+Tyjae Spears was an absolute gem in the late 3rd, scoring our only TD on the road.

Now for the negatives.

-Run defense. Teair Tart‚Äôs paycheck just got a lot larger today. Zach Moss kept running up the gut for at least 4 yards, and our linebackers couldn‚Äôt do anything. He accounted for Indy‚Äôs two touchdowns yesterday, so if we were as good as we‚Äôve been over the last few seasons, we likely win that game. I don‚Äôt want to hear a fucking word about how it‚Äôs meaningless or useless to have a great run defense *ever again*. You lost that right with our first loss at Lucas Oil in five seasons.

-On that note, the pass rush looked awful today. Two QB hits and only one sack (hello, Mr. McCreary). If the front 7 doesn‚Äôt click, we don‚Äôt have any defense to speak of and we lose because of...

-The secondary. Fourth straight game without an interception, one pass deflection. Byard‚Äôs been simply a guy that makes tackles instead of someone that‚Äôs making plays like he used to. McCreary‚Äôs been a good slot corner, and SMB‚Äôs been nice, but that‚Äôs about it for the secondary. Don‚Äôt even get me started on‚Ä¶

-Kristian Fulton. He had the aforementioned pass deflection, but overall, he‚Äôs a useless dumbass that gets his lunch eaten on basic double moves and leads the NFL in DPI flags. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather play Avery or Farley in his spot knowing damn well that they likely won‚Äôt be better, but at least we‚Äôll have clarity on letting them walk.

-Redzone offense. What the hell‚Äôs going on here? Seriously, that was the one aspect of offense that clicked even if we‚Äôd hardly get there. Now, our offense is excellent at edging before failing to deliver the final payout.

-Run game. Seriously, Derrick Henry looks mediocre. Slow, unable to evade tackles, overwhelmed in the backfield. Run blocking and Colts linebacker and interior be damned, Tyjae‚Äôs done more with the same. 

-Receivers. We had D-Hop, but that‚Äôs it, only NWI caught a pass. Okonkwo needs to hit the Jugs machine with all the drops he‚Äôs had this season. Just a very uneven performance overall

-This wasn‚Äôt just our first loss at Lucas Oil in the post-Luck era, it was our only divisional game before mid-November. Almost every single prediction that had us making the playoffs depended on us winning this game. Now, we‚Äôre going across the pond to face a Ravens team with a better secondary and another mean linebacker room as well as an above average quarterback.

111,k454syl,,"First of all, we didn't look like total crap even in a loss. Which is refreshing honestly üò¨

Offense wise, our playcalling had issues (especially 4th and 1 call), but otherwise it is vastly improved from last year. Guys are being schemed open, and whenever the broadcast cuts to Kelly, he actually looks like he knows what the fuck he's doing. Like seriously, I feel like obviously our offense is better than last year, but in many ways it's better than when we had ABJ. And by that I mean in terms of better playcalling, playing to our strengths mostly. Even in 2019, we were often relying on our individual elite players to make plays, rather than effectively setting them up to make those plays. It worked because they were elite, but a lot of times it looked messy, and could be shut down by an elite team, which happened often in the playoffs. 

Look, Kelly is not Andy Reid or Shanahan, but I'm so happy with what I've seen from him so far. A massive breath of fresh air. I think our main issues yesterday were poor OL play, especially run blocking, and lacking a downfield threat like Burks to stretch the field. Hopefully both can improve as the season goes on. DHop looked INCREDIBLE yesterday I must say, truly can catch anything remotely near him. He is aging like wine.

Defense wise, yesterday was not their day. They got bullied up and down the field. Fulton is not it, and we missed Tart. I suspect the Colts OL has greatly improved. I don't know exactly how they could improve the rest of the season beyond hoping yesterday was just a down day though.

Young players that need to make more of an impact: Chig, Burks, Fulton (all three have been tremendously disappointing.)

Tannehill is on this list as well, but he's picked it up lately. Both Simmons and Landry have become one dimensional pass rushers and aren't as good at their other fits (Simmons with the run game and Landry with coverage) and both need to play better or their contracts will become a handcuff. (We can't be paying 48M for the 36th ranked interior defender. We are supposed to have one of the best interiors in the league.)

But yeah, these 5 guys have been contributing the most to the shitty start to the season. Simmons, Landry, Chig, Burks, and Fulton. PFF identifies them as performing even worse than the depth level guys aside from Simmons who has performed thus far this season like a borderline starter in the NFL. Some of them have grades below 50. The highest grade amongst these players are 60. Our role players (guys like Gibbens, NWI etc) have been performing in their role like a playoff team would, but the guys we need to take us there largely have not done their job.

All of them have underperformed relative to their expectations. Simmons is safe but there may be a trade in the near future with one of Henry/Landry. I think Henry is a rough fit in this current offense and the direction of the team indicates to me that they might be moving on from the veterans based on how they've played thus far. 2-4 at the bye, it might be time to try and get some draft picks for Henry/Tannehill and let the kids roll the rest of the way and see what happens.  Burks and Chig have to play better or the direction of the team will change for them. Burks is safer than Chig. We're already seeing more Josh Whyle than anticipated and with every holding call and OPI, Chig is in danger of losing his job to the kid.

Nothing Vrabel can do when 7 of your highest paid guys are underperforming relative to the expectations. The coaching has been there and we've been in every game *except one* but the depth guys can't carry when the big dogs lose their matchups.",BurzyGuerrero,2023-10-09 16:10:15,173sand
125,k45df22,,"1. We are an example of roster building and philosophy going in opposite directions. JRob got so busy trying to play Jedi mind tricks he forgot what he was trying to build, which was the biggest, meanest, physical football team in the league. He started there, a lot of his picks early were guys who had performed extremely well in college, but had been underrated for one reason or another. By the end he was trying to play to his own ego pushing around AJ, and focusing entirely on finding the diamonds in the tough, not necessarily guys who had been eminently productive in college. We are now, small, slow, and without the big meanies we need to put physical other teams. Need to either abandon the vrabel philosophy (and probably vrabel himself), and build the light fast team, or go back to getting the large imposing guys. 


2. Kelly impressed me yesterday for the most part. He is figuring it out. His RZ play calling was absolutely atrocious, but I'm loving the varied formations, way he is using guys in different ways, etc. 


3. Chig is not as good as we thought. Not saying he's a bust, but we probably should have grabbed Darnell Washington despite his lack of production in Pitt. At least he can block and is a true red zone threat. Chig is too small to be a true leaper/high point RZ TE, his hands are inconsistent, and he isn't a great blocker. 


4. I've been ready to move on from Tanny since week 1. He's not as bad as I thought, but his arm clearly isn't what it once was and his mechanics look really different from past seasons. Not sure if he can't grip the ball right anymore, or if he just can't get the zip, but something is really off. I'm also by no means a hater, I have defended him in years past and love what he has brought to this team.

J-Rob ***purposefully ignored the numerous red flag warnings*** on Wilson.  Georgia coaches told the Titan scouts about all the red flags and shady baggage that he came with.

Fulton has been flagged a lot, so officials watch him closely, and anything debateable is flagged. 

I also think Vrabel needs to throw a bigger fit when some of these flags are thrown. He just watches the replay and acts like ""Oh well, just the way it goes."" Well, someone needs to get onto the officials at some point, because we know the league won't. But he's so over Fulton at this point, he won't even complain because he knows it's more routine for him to be flagged...

I do think at some point we might as well get an FA CB, or play a backup. Cannot be worse. When Farley is ready to return, I could easily see him taking Fulton's spot. But we know he has not been all that great...",Mythic514,2023-10-09 12:40:56,17395zl

You do not trade away picks to move up for a QB in the 2nd Rd, especially the amount of holes and little depth on the roster.

You are basically committed to throwing away one year of a rookie QB deal, which is the cheat code to having a contending roster. You've also made it hard to take advantage of that contract in Yr 2 because of scarce draft picks.

The Hopkins deal also meant restructuring Landry, who is shockingly (/s) struggling this season after tearing his ACL last year.

Every team in the NFL wants to win the Super Bowl every year, but I think it would be more effective to have somewhat aspirational but realistic milestones to hit year after year (I.E we were 2-15 last year and we just got a guy who we think can be a franchise QB our goal is to evaluate his progress and hopefully get our win total around the 6/7 mark this year).

We're half in and half out, once again. If we want to give one last shot to the Tanney/Henry combo, then just go all out and take a huge swing and we'll deal with the fallout later. If we've identified the vets aren't good enough to make contention realistic, let's trade assets while they still have value and you absolutely HAVE to play the young QBs so you can gauge if you have a guy or if you still need to be looking. 

But what we're doing is quintessentially half-measures.

* **Improved, but not enough:** the offense moved the chains, but they couldn't score touchdowns in the red zone. I'm glad to see the offense use DHop more. He can really open things up for the rest of the offense, if there was a ""rest of the offense."" Everyone else underperformed. 

* **Better than expected:** the O-line did okay. We can say they didn't lose the game, at least. They still need help, and that help would better serve down the field to catch passes. But the O-line has to get better at being on their own. They certainly need to get better at run blocking.

* **Fulton sucks:** maybe he _was_ good, and maybe he does have athletic ability, but I can name a few guys like that from the Ruston Webster era that didn't amount to anything. Fulton is a liability that is harming the team. If you say, ""They have no other choice,"" I say at this point anyone else. The same argument you would have for Dillard or Daley.

It was a half-assed fake handoff against a defensive line that was going to penetrate on 4th and 1, no matter what. If you are going to get cute with misdirection, you do it for a pass.

1. We aren't winning anything important this year. It's just not happening. We may rip off a few wins, but we aren't going to be able to keep up with the blue chips.

2. Our o-line is still shaky AF, and from what I can tell, RT can't handle the pressure.

3. Stroud and Richardson are starting for their teams, and they're getting better every week. Meanwhile, our future is sitting on the bench, missing out on very valuable reps. By the time the team decides to move on from RT, whichever QB we start is going to be playing catchup to the 3 other young QBs in our division.

Something has to change offensively. We can't keep scoring less than 17 points and expect to win anything of note. The defense has good games and bad games. More good than bad.

Offense did a lot of good things - Hopkins and Spears were both rolling, and Tannehill was throwing dimes between the 20s - and we were one Hopkins foot down and a fourth and 1 conversion away from having two more TDs. 

Defense was brutal, but sometimes you have to tip your cap to the other team‚Äôs play caller. The Colts knew Fulton‚Äôs tendencies and exposed them over and over, and obviously they found a soft spot scheme wise in our run defense that no one else has in awhile

I personally have no desire to see our young QBs yet, as we have first-hand experience on how brutal Malik is under center. And if Levis can‚Äôt beat him out to be active on gamedays, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs close to ready yet either.",Ok-Plan-6277,2023-10-09 15:44:30,173sand
99,k44rrti,,"It wasn't that bad of a game, really.

Our offence was a bit one-dimensional but still functional. If things had bounced our way in the redzone, we could have came away with TDs instead of FGs and won the game pretty handily. I'm pleased with how the offensive line seems to be developing--it'll obviously have issues with elite pass rushes like the Browns, but they're on their way to being solidly mediocre against most opponents, which is definitely better than I expected them to be before the season. 

Offensive playcalling was interesting. It was great to see Hopkins have a big game. With the exception of the attempted Henry TD pass, though, it seemed much less inventive than what we saw last week, and that's how we managed to get our other receivers involved. I feel like they come out and do something quite different each game. That's probably a good thing, but it'd be nice if they could change things up when it's clear that their plan isn't quite working as well as they'd hoped.

Our defence was worrying. I'm not too surprised that our secondary gave up big plays, but I'm disappointed that our pash rush wasn't able to affect the game more. They seem *good*, but that isn't always amounting to sacks or turnovers. And the loss of Tart obviously hurt our run defence immensely--no wonder he wants to get paid. But they more or less managed to keep us in the game right until the very end, so it's hard to be too mad. (Obviously there were some infuriating specific issues, but those have been discussed in detail by this point. I will just say that I think Fulton was a wee bit unlucky to be called for *both* pass interferences. Not that they were bad calls as such, but the second one at least was borderline, and could easily have been missed).

I had pretty low expectations coming into this season and am just glad to see us play in competitive games (yes, the Browns game was a fucking disaster, but we've otherwise looked at least solidly *okay*). I know it's disappointing to accept mediocrity, but I've kind of reconciled myself to that just being where we are as a team right now. So I'm enjoying the highs, like our fun, close victory over the Chargers and our domination of the Bengals, and doing my best not to get too worked up about the losses.

Two young promising QBs that can develop in a stacked roster.

Feels like the year before we brought in Vrabel, Malcom Butler, Logan Ryan et al and really started to make noise.

That said, yesterday was a winnable game and we didn't make the plays to win it. We punted once on like 7 drives and scored 16 points. It's inexcusable.

I'd say my biggest frustration is our over commitment to Henry in big Downs like the 4th down. I know he's an amazing player, but every team is willing to lose ANY WAY other than at the hands of Henry.

Case in point, we scored in four plays on the one drive Henry basically never got the ball.

I want to see the Titans come out and literally just play action pass so frequently that the defense has to give up on the stop Henry plan. So many times we just dunk on people play after play and then decide we have to stop doing what's working so Henry can get his touches and it fucks us EVERY TIME.

When we played the Pats in '19 Bill lined up in two high shell the whole game to take away the explosive passes. He essentially gave Henry 200+ yards and STILL only allowed 14 points to the offense.

The more teams fear the pass the better off Henry will be, and they refuse to fear it and we refuse to punish them for it *consistently*. That is by far my biggest frustration.",iMixMusicOnTwitch,2023-10-09 14:35:54,173sand

+Andre Dillard wasn‚Äôt completely terrible yesterday. Heck, pass protection wasn‚Äôt bad allowing only one sack.

+Tyjae Spears was an absolute gem in the late 3rd, scoring our only TD on the road.

Now for the negatives.

-Run defense. Teair Tart‚Äôs paycheck just got a lot larger today. Zach Moss kept running up the gut for at least 4 yards, and our linebackers couldn‚Äôt do anything. He accounted for Indy‚Äôs two touchdowns yesterday, so if we were as good as we‚Äôve been over the last few seasons, we likely win that game. I don‚Äôt want to hear a fucking word about how it‚Äôs meaningless or useless to have a great run defense *ever again*. You lost that right with our first loss at Lucas Oil in five seasons.

-On that note, the pass rush looked awful today. Two QB hits and only one sack (hello, Mr. McCreary). If the front 7 doesn‚Äôt click, we don‚Äôt have any defense to speak of and we lose because of...

-The secondary. Fourth straight game without an interception, one pass deflection. Byard‚Äôs been simply a guy that makes tackles instead of someone that‚Äôs making plays like he used to. McCreary‚Äôs been a good slot corner, and SMB‚Äôs been nice, but that‚Äôs about it for the secondary. Don‚Äôt even get me started on‚Ä¶

-Kristian Fulton. He had the aforementioned pass deflection, but overall, he‚Äôs a useless dumbass that gets his lunch eaten on basic double moves and leads the NFL in DPI flags. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather play Avery or Farley in his spot knowing damn well that they likely won‚Äôt be better, but at least we‚Äôll have clarity on letting them walk.

-Redzone offense. What the hell‚Äôs going on here? Seriously, that was the one aspect of offense that clicked even if we‚Äôd hardly get there. Now, our offense is excellent at edging before failing to deliver the final payout.

-Run game. Seriously, Derrick Henry looks mediocre. Slow, unable to evade tackles, overwhelmed in the backfield. Run blocking and Colts linebacker and interior be damned, Tyjae‚Äôs done more with the same. 

-Receivers. We had D-Hop, but that‚Äôs it, only NWI caught a pass. Okonkwo needs to hit the Jugs machine with all the drops he‚Äôs had this season. Just a very uneven performance overall

-This wasn‚Äôt just our first loss at Lucas Oil in the post-Luck era, it was our only divisional game before mid-November. Almost every single prediction that had us making the playoffs depended on us winning this game.

Offense wise, our playcalling had issues (especially 4th and 1 call), but otherwise it is vastly improved from last year. Guys are being schemed open, and whenever the broadcast cuts to Kelly, he actually looks like he knows what the fuck he's doing. Like seriously, I feel like obviously our offense is better than last year, but in many ways it's better than when we had ABJ. And by that I mean in terms of better playcalling, playing to our strengths mostly. Even in 2019, we were often relying on our individual elite players to make plays, rather than effectively setting them up to make those plays. It worked because they were elite, but a lot of times it looked messy, and could be shut down by an elite team, which happened often in the playoffs. 

Look, Kelly is not Andy Reid or Shanahan, but I'm so happy with what I've seen from him so far. A massive breath of fresh air.

148,k45avml,,"Big money players not making an impact: Jeffrey Simmons (ranked 8th on the defense), Harold Landry (24th on the defense),

Young players that need to make more of an impact: Chig, Burks, Fulton (all three have been tremendously disappointing.)

Tannehill is on this list as well, but he's picked it up lately. Both Simmons and Landry have become one dimensional pass rushers and aren't as good at their other fits (Simmons with the run game and Landry with coverage) and both need to play better or their contracts will become a handcuff. (We can't be paying 48M for the 36th ranked interior defender. We are supposed to have one of the best interiors in the league.)

But yeah, these 5 guys have been contributing the most to the shitty start to the season. Simmons, Landry, Chig, Burks, and Fulton. PFF identifies them as performing even worse than the depth level guys aside from Simmons who has performed thus far this season like a borderline starter in the NFL. Some of them have grades below 50. The highest grade amongst these players are 60. Our role players (guys like Gibbens, NWI etc) have been performing in their role like a playoff team would, but the guys we need to take us there largely have not done their job.

All of them have underperformed relative to their expectations. Simmons is safe but there may be a trade in the near future with one of Henry/Landry. I think Henry is a rough fit in this current offense and the direction of the team indicates to me that they might be moving on from the veterans based on how they've played thus far. 2-4 at the bye, it might be time to try and get some draft picks for Henry/Tannehill and let the kids roll the rest of the way and see what happens.  Burks and Chig have to play better or the direction of the team will change for them. Burks is safer than Chig. We're already seeing more Josh Whyle than anticipated and with every holding call and OPI, Chig is in danger of losing his job to the kid.

Nothing Vrabel can do when 7 of your highest paid guys are underperforming relative to the expectations. The coaching has been there and we've been in every game *except one* but the depth guys can't carry when the big dogs lose their matchups.",BurzyGuerrero,2023-10-09 16:10:15,173sand
149,k45df22,,"1. We are an example of roster building and philosophy going in opposite directions. JRob got so busy trying to play Jedi mind tricks he forgot what he was trying to build, which was the biggest, meanest, physical football team in the league. He started there, a lot of his picks early were guys who had performed extremely well in college, but had been underrated for one reason or another. By the end he was trying to play to his own ego pushing around AJ, and focusing entirely on finding the diamonds in the tough, not necessarily guys who had been eminently productive in college. We are now, small, slow, and without the big meanies we need to put physical other teams. Need to either abandon the vrabel philosophy (and probably vrabel himself), and build the light fast team, or go back to getting the large imposing guys. 


2. Kelly impressed me yesterday for the most part. He is figuring it out. His RZ play calling was absolutely atrocious, but I'm loving the varied formations, way he is using guys in different ways, etc. 


3. Chig is not as good as we thought. Not saying he's a bust, but we probably should have grabbed Darnell Washington despite his lack of production in Pitt. At least he can block and is a true red zone threat. Chig is too small to be a true leaper/high point RZ TE, his hands are inconsistent, and he isn't a great blocker. 


4. I've been ready to move on from Tanny since week 1. He's not as bad as I thought, but his arm clearly isn't what it once was and his mechanics look really different from past seasons. Not sure if he can't grip the ball right anymore, or if he just can't get the zip, but something is really off. I'm also by no means a hater, I have defended him in years past and love what he has brought to this team. But I'm ready to ship him off for whatever draft picks we can get and see what we have for the future.

You do not trade away picks to move up for a QB in the 2nd Rd, especially the amount of holes and little depth on the roster.

You are basically committed to throwing away one year of a rookie QB deal, which is the cheat code to having a contending roster. You've also made it hard to take advantage of that contract in Yr 2 because of scarce draft picks.

The Hopkins deal also meant restructuring Landry, who is shockingly (/s) struggling this season after tearing his ACL last year.

298,k43v16w,,"It‚Äôs a cap league. Every team has a cycle. The Titans are well into the point of diminishing returns with theirs.

The Titans tried to put it over the top a few years ago. It was a good attempt but it didn‚Äôt happen. They had to pay for Julio Jones and other moves last year and had a bad OL. Their draft picks didn‚Äôt work out. What FAs they got did not work out. They took what they had and tried to put the best run-blocking guys out there. Pass-protection was terrible.

This year, the PP is marginally better but run-blocking is worse. It wasn‚Äôt very good to start with.

The Titans are a counter-trend team. They go against current fashion and what they try to do is create a strength were other teams are weak. This isn‚Äôt a bad strategy per se and is not really the problem. In theory, the players you need for your system are in less demand frm other teams and easier to acquire.

The issue is their drafts were terrible. They burned one pick on an OL that didn‚Äôt make it a season. They took a first-round CB who barely played. They traded one of their best players to draft a WR in the first who has been hurt. They took another OL high who hasn‚Äôt been very good. They used extra draft capital to take two backup QBs. They drafted a second running back who is a nice player but probably a luxury they could not afford. And it‚Äôs not like they found diamonds late in the draft.

Guys are always getting old or moving on. You have to get new, quality players and if you can‚Äôt draft them or buy them, you are in trouble.

The rest of the team is about to fall apart. It‚Äôs the NFL so they will win some games but it is fairly ugly.",evanwilliams212,2023-10-09 08:53:58,173h9gx

I mean I love her to death (great owner would never want to replacer her) but she doesn't have Jeff Bezos money to throw around and it shows with a lot of Jrob's value picks and our lack of converting cap hits into signing bonuses in any significant way.

Nah, doubling down just digs the hole deeper and keeps us in cap hell longer only reason we didn't push the rebuild button this year the second AJ left is because we had aspirations of grandeur from getting the number 1 seed last year and hoping every obviously bad decision (like not fixing the Oline) would work itself out... which it didn't.",RyokoKnight,2022-12-04 22:50:13,zclw5g

Couple points:


1. I'm not sure how players being on IR is a GM issue but ok.


2. Who exactly have we let ""walk out the door"" that went and was productive on the contract they got from their new team outside of AJ who demanded a trade after an offer of $20mil/year? Jonnu? Corey Davis? Conklin is the only name and we didn't pick up his 5th year because he looked bad coming off a blown knee. I'm not sure who all these phantom players are that we let go that are over performing on other teams.


3. The O line magically got bad when our starting LT got hurt. That's not a coincidence and I'm not sure what you expect. Teams don't just have starting LTs sitting on their bench. You're going to feel that loss no matter who you are.


4. Not sure how he ""dismantled"" the receiving room beyond trading a reciever that stopped communicating and demanded a trade. We've been down our 1st and 3rd receivers most of the year and have been starting a backup left tackle, on top of having an inept offensive coordinator (which is a Vrabel hire btw). It sounds like you just expect to have starters top to bottom which isn't how the league works.


5. The fact that we've had to make cap decisions is a testament to how well we've drafted overall. You don't get into cap hell by paying shitty players. JRob is responsible for Tannehill, Henry, Hilliard, Okonkwo, Ben Jones, Davis, Burks, Simmons, Autry, Landry, Tart, Ola, David Long, Fulton, Byard, Hooker, and a host of other role players and young guys with upside like Molden, Philips, etc. He also brought in the same guys you're upset at losing (AJ, Jonnu, CD, Adoree, Jayon Brown, Jack Conklin, etc).


Apparently you didn't watch during the dark ages of Ruston Webster and don't know what an ACTUAL bad roster looks like. Most of that team wouldn't make our practice squad now. The fact that this team has been a perennial playoff contender since JRob took that team over and you want to just toss that out the window because of 2 1st round whiffs and a 2nd round gem of a receiver that wanted to play someplace else is astounding. Has he been perfect? No. Is he better than most of the rest of the GMs in the league? Yes.

(maybe a bit shorter if EVERYTHING goes our way, a great and loyal new OC would go a long way... also having Malik step up to the starting role and do well).",RyokoKnight,2022-12-04 23:11:00,zclw5g
351,iyxnkte,iyxn90v,People with faith in Malik worry me. As someone who lives down the road from Liberty and went to games the past couple years I am not sold on him. Dude struggled to read defenses like Middle Tennessee state and Louisiana-Monroe. There‚Äôs a reason he was behind Stedham,strickyricky88,2022-12-04 23:13:20,zclw5g
352,iyxsa5y,iyxnkte,"Last years QB picks were... lets face it... awful. Malik has potential to be a true elite talent but he's a long way off and not there yet by any means. SO the best thing we could have done this year would be to tank hard as a franchise (knowing full well we aren't a superbowl caliber team) and grab a top tier QB this draft. 

Then you cut Tanne and all the expensive players like Dupree, Lewan, etc. draft Oline and WR with the remaining picks filling out a cheaper need or two in FA. 

Then we'd be able to play the season game to game, letting both QB's battle for the top position sharpening them both against each other and in the end whoever's best is the one we keep at QB 1... keeping the other at QB 2 or trading/cutting depending on outcome. 

That path at least would have guaranteed us a good - great caliber QB going forward... and maximized our chances of hitting at the most important position in the game. 

Malik has done everything right this season though, my goals for him post draft night, were they he become QB 2 by the end of the year... and he's done that. Proved it when he took Mahomes into overtime which is more than most QB 2's could do in all honesty. 

Next year the test will be if he can give a player like Tanne a run for the QB 1 spot by the end of the year... if he can he's probably good enough to consider the future of the franchise for a while... if not... we will probably be looking for a new QB sooner rather than later and playing the rebuild game all over again.",RyokoKnight,2022-12-04 23:46:43,zclw5g
353,iyxtwxl,iyxsa5y,This is why I didn‚Äôt want one last year. We‚Äôre at a point now we can cut Tannehill and pray or keep him and pray.

We‚Äôre nearly 3/4 of the season completed and honestly haven‚Äôt heard any discussion of him being up there,strickyricky88,2022-12-04 23:58:31,zclw5g
354,iyxwupa,iyxtwxl,"Ehh... I mean like I said Malik has done everything we could ask for this year... why not give him a shot next year... cut Tanne... whats the worst that can happen we have a bad year and are in a position to draft a QB in 2024... oh no... how terrible... you know. 

Someone like Drake Maye or Caleb Williams will be up in the first round that year and we could grab them. (Both have had a 4,000+ yard season 66% Completion or better, 35+ TDs) Either could have a breakout year as well and improve on what is already a pretty good college start.",RyokoKnight,2022-12-05 00:19:43,zclw5g
355,iyxx4bf,iyxwupa,I mean if your willing the team to go backwards than sure. But I rather not root for a team who goes backwards again. I honestly feel if we go the Malik route Vrabel is gone sooner and we‚Äôre going back to the courses we went for awhile,strickyricky88,2022-12-05 00:21:34,zclw5g
356,iyxywif,iyxx4bf,"I mean you could say the same about keeping with an expensive aging QB like Tanne who is good but not great QB. 

Or the fact that Henry has slowed a step this year and can't lift the team offensively like he used to (granted the offensive line is garbage but it was also bad last year and until his injury Henry still looked dominant on the field).

Point is we are going to have to move on... we cannot win a super bowl with what we have, we don't have the cap to afford the players we'd need to become a super bowl team, and the good players we do have are aging out... 

Change is coming one way or another SO you can embrace it and work toward  a better future, or you can try to deny it and cling to mediocrity at 9-8 (which may very well be our record this year oddly enough).",RyokoKnight,2022-12-05 00:34:44,zclw5g

Sure... i'm not going to refute a single thing you said... but the cap hit... is the cap hit... is the cap hit. Regardless of WHY he is expensive, he is expensive next year and there really isn't much we can do about it now. 

>We‚Äôre not winning with Malik

We aren't going to be winning much with Tanne either, realistically we have too many holes and not enough cap space with him on the team to address them adequately, and even if we did by some miracle to what end... another 1 and done in the playoffs where Tanne turns into a pumpkin on national television? Why is that the end goal for this team?

Look your complaining about Malik who is half baked this year and its something we all knew when we drafted him. He should only be at around a true rookie QB level starting next year, I get you don't like him... thats fine... but ultimately we don't have much choice anymore unless you want to draft another QB next year. 

Best we could do with our current draft spot is Anthony Richardson (who will basically be at the same level as Willis and arguably less overall upside) or maybe Hendon Hooker who will be 25 come draft night, high floor, low ceiling... and even if it panned out and he's a great QB in the NFL (which isn't particularly likely) he may not make it on the team a full decade before we are already looking to replace him... that's not great when teams typically like to invest heavily around their franchise QB.  

Any option we take we aren't likely to improve over what Tanne gave us last year... and thus yes... we are going to regress, it is more or less inevitable now, short of something truly wacky happening.",RyokoKnight,2022-12-05 01:14:18,zclw5g

As I‚Äôve said let them battle in camp whoever wins is starter you keep the other for backup. Worst case you make moves in a future draft

But I‚Äôd also say putting full blame on Tannehill for last year is scapegoating the issues we had. Shit play calling, shit secondary (which has been exposed against )",strickyricky88,2022-12-05 01:16:14,zclw5g

But at the end of the day we win that same bengals game with half the turnovers or a QB with a slightly better completion percentage.

I blame him... because he was at fault, QB is the most important position in the game, a great game from a QB can make a mediocre team into a good one, a poor showing can make a top team look completely inept.

He made us look completely inept, and we can talk about downing's role as well... but at the end of the day the aspects only the QB can manage weren't managed well at all.",RyokoKnight,2022-12-05 01:32:01,zclw5g

431,iyxbmjt,,"Honestly, any hopes for a playoff win are out the window. Only reason we get into playoff is because our division is that bad. So really my only thoughts are how do we fix everything before next season? 

The obvious issue is pretty much everything with our offense (Horrible OLine, receiver core, and play calling) but it's also pretty clear that our secondary defense is just plain bad. The only positives we have on this team are our defensive line, Stonehouse, and flashes of skill with burks and chig.

My biggest concern is that we're gunna end with a good enough record and possibly another packers game where downing doesn't call a game that takes place in the 90s and then he somehow keeps his job for next season. 

I do still have some faith in JRob to fix the OLine/ secondary issues but that faith is one questionable off season away from being completely gone. 

Lastly anyone who has an issue with AJ Brown is just in denial. He wanted to be paid like a WR of his skill should be. He went to a place that paid him and now he's literally putting his money where his mouth is by out performing our entire receiving core.",C_C_Holthaus98,2022-12-04 21:49:25,zclw5g

His past two drafts have been awful guys, his FA signings minus a few haven't hit like that. We got practice squad castaways getting main minutes and they actually do fine. Why? Because with good talent and depth, this team would be Top 3 in the league cause that's how good Vrabel is. DH is 28 now, gonna be 29 on my Bday which is Playoff time.

And downing is downing.

And don't give me the ""oh but look where he has brought us from"" bullshit. Yes good we went from a bottom 5 team to a team with an auto one and done playoff run because our division sucks and we have a once in a generation player in Henry. But currently JRob has shown that the team's ceiling with him is one and done playoffs. We have guys we could have built around for a super bowl run. We had guys that could have made a super bowl run. And they were all wasted. That's on JRob. Today is on JRob. The line is on JRob. The receivers are on JRob. Downing is on both JRob and Vrabel.

Even so, Hurts and Burrow didn‚Äôt become good players until their last years‚Ä¶ again, when they had situations that were perfectly suited to them. Even Josh Allen‚Äôs last year at Wyoming drew tons of criticism, and similar to Levis, came after his actual weapons left for the NFL.

Watch any Kentucky game from 2022 and you will see plenty of misses from Levis. But at the same time you will see plenty of drops, the offensive line totally collapsing before Levis can even get to his dropback, or guys just not getting open. His offensive supporting cast was *bad*. And that‚Äôs not to say that Levis will magically solve his issues in the pros, because there‚Äôs a decent probability he won‚Äôt.

Levis played poorly against Tennessee for sure, but by that point had been dealing with lingering injuries that multiple sources (I.e., Dane Brugler) said were pretty severe. Couple this with an OL that was literally 120th in the nation at that point in sacks allowed, and there‚Äôs good reason why Levis was bad. 

And the thing is I‚Äôm not even a big Levis fan because I think he has real issues with pressure that I can only hope iron themselves out when he has some semblance of a competent team around him. But when people just look at stats showing how efficient Henson Hooker was without really acknowledging that his offensive infrastructure was tailor made for him and had the best possible cast for that offense, while at the same time discounting Levis although he had literally none of that last year, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense and is extremely lazy.",AsiansEnjoyRice,2023-04-29 04:06:11,132disw

We won't draft an actually good QB next year, which is a shame cause I actually thought Vrabel learned a lesson from ""trash in college QB"" legend Malik Willis but I guess not. 

Honestly I'm ready for the next iteration of this team. Let's get a head coach who doesn't want to recreate the 1950s for once. One who values a pass game and hires the coordinators to make it happen. 

Sucks for Ran cause he has to pick players Vrabel wants him to get, but it's going to cost him the job in 2 years when this doesn't pan out. Then Henry really will be done, and it'll be full rebuild time. Hopefully we get the right guy then, but this move screams of desperation in Vrabel trying to do this one more time.

Vrabel has what every coach wants, which is the utmost respect from the players and the ability to create an inclusive, team-oriented but player-focused culture in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. He is a players coach. He is relatively young and he understands what it‚Äôs like to be a player in the modern NFL.  He always sticks up for his guys and never throws them under the bus even when they don‚Äôt deserve it from him (e.g. Isiah Wilson, Vic Beasley). He knows the necessity to focus on what you can control and to teach players to be confident in themselves.

He deserves a lot of credit for what he has been able to accomplish at Tennessee and the culture he has established. He absolutely needs to hire a defensive coordinator and both him and JR need to focus heavily on defensive personnel in the offseason. Arthur Smith is still new to the OC game, but I definitely wonder if a lot of his success is simply due to having a lot of talent.

Tannehill needs to do more because Henry has just looked sluggish these last few games, but it would help if our receivers would step up and get open. Hooper and Chig provide some relief for Tannehill but I, personally, would like to see chig used as more of a vertical threat Than what he's been used as. That happened a little more often last week. 

So can we win if all that happens? Maybe. Do I think it can happen? Not against DAL for sure. But if we go 2-2 (including beating jacksonville) we'll make the playoffs and if we match up against anyone not Bengals or Bills, we can at least win wild card weekend. 

I like our chances against KC, only Cincinnati scares me, and Buffalo scares me less. No reason we couldn't play them tough though. Best case scenario would be AFCCG IF all goes well.

Its been a couple days since this topic cropped back up and already I've heard season ticket holders say they will drop their tickets if he is signed by the Titans. And I've heard people say that they should sign him to start as he is better than Tannehill. Those same people would be crying for him to start with every incomplete pass. 

He might be the most polarizing figure in football at the moment. 

And you don't want that attention from a guy that is gonna just be sitting on the bench anyways. 

Not only that but NFL teams typically only carry 2 Quarterbacks. 

What would be the point of having Tannehill, Cap and a rookie? If you are drafting a Quarterback its to be the future. And in that case if he isn't capable of serving as a backup then you made the wrong pick anyways. 

Depending on where you draft a quarterback that also puts you at potentially having a good deal of money tied into the position with 3 different guys.",tngman10,2019-11-17 06:38:26,dxhg4j

Barring unforeseen circumstances, Tannehill is the starter next year, but we need a QB of the future and Kaepernick is definitely not that guy.

If we draft a QB this year, and we probably should, he has to be our back up in the short term with potential to be the starter long term.

Beyond that, he‚Äôd either be just a practice team guy or he‚Äôd be taking reps away from the rookie in practice.

He's just not there yet. Hopefully he gets there. But as of today it's clear he's not ready and it's not a guy we can win with.

They all MADE the Super Bowl because they had high draft picks that turned into blue chip talent. You can throw the Panthers in there as well for Super Bowl appearance with Cam.

Moving the goal post again.

Your argument is that teams don't tank or have below a 7-9 season the year before they aquired a QB that won them a Super Bowl.

When you are proven wrong, you can't just say ""well, um...""

This isn't necessarily tank for one player. It's hitting the reset button, letting young guys play and be evaluated and acquiring draft assets which will help improve the team.

>6-10 isn‚Äôt tanking, he was picked outside of the top 10, but even if it is, that‚Äôs still less than a third of the Super Bowls.

Moving the goal post again. Your cherry-picked stat said 7-9.

Tom Brady also takes up a third of those Super Bowl wins, so your stat is already going to be heavily scewed on a MASSIVE outlier, but that's OK. We're going through this 7-9 or better exercise .

>That‚Äôs great they made it, that‚Äôs great we made it, but we didn‚Äôt win it.

It matters because when you start going back and looking at teams that made it, you're going to see A LOT had bottom 10 or worse records, drafted a QB high and made a Super Bowl appearance within 5 years.

Peyton
Eli
Big Ben

But even I would remind anyone that they aren't a sure thing, they might be the best prospects since Lawrence, but they could both fail to stick at the nfl level.

If we somehow get a top 3 pick and have a shot at one of those QBs... you take them... run 3 QBs again let them compete for the spot... sure Caleb or Drake probably take it but you let them compete all the same for the ""what if""... to GUARANTEE you get the best QB available.

you then trade off the 3rd mid season to a QB needy team if possibly or cut them flat out and accept you have your guy for 8 ish years and can start to build around them and their needs.

And here is the best part lets say you get Caleb and he turns out to be a diva... well you can always bench him and trade him for a kings ransom and run out your 2nd who's had that much longer to develop and learn how the top QB did it. It worked for Jordon love and green bay it can work for us.

1152,k27rjkg,k27p2ud,"The thing is the AFC south sucks so much I still don‚Äôt see us being at worse under 5 wins. I think the Broncos and Bears will most likely be worse and biggest reason why is cause they‚Äôre in harder divisions. I think the Bears and the Broncos are the two worse teams this year and will probably get Caleb and Maye. Then the cardinals but they look kinda scrappy is the problem for them if they‚Äôre tanking. And now here‚Äôs my question do you go for a third qb if you not only can‚Äôt get Caleb or Maye but also can‚Äôt get a guy like Penix or possibly even  Bo? Honestly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd go for Bo cause I saw him in the SEC. He couldn‚Äôt handle it and if he can‚Äôt handle SEC defense then NFL is another level and sure it‚Äôs been a few years but always that thought. Do you go for Penix? He‚Äôs older and looks good so far so maybe a first rounder but I feel we have bigger needs. Like I‚Äôd only get Penix with a late 1st in our current state and Bo in the second and beyond. Some later round guys I think a great guy we might be able to get in the 3rd or 4th is a guy like KJ Jefferson honestly. We don‚Äôt lose a lot in draft capital, I‚Äôve liked what I‚Äôve seen from him in Arkansas, and also he has that relationship with Burks that might make them have a great connection in games since they‚Äôve played with each other in the past. Also I think his play style fits our offense. Maybe for a bit of a miss guy we take a guy like Milton late in the draft like 5th or 6th and back since he might be around till even the last round and while he‚Äôs a hit or Miss as we‚Äôve seen from college so far he would be a nice take if he‚Äôs left in the last round cause you lose basically nothing and his potential ceiling is high. But pretty much what I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôd worry about places like CB and Oline before we think of qb since those are biggest issues but if a guy like Penix or Bo falls then I‚Äôd take them in the second and KJ I‚Äôd take mid draft and Joe Milton I would take around the end of the draft if we want a qb.",DickThunders,2023-09-26 00:23:03,16s5rbl

1155,k27x4a5,k27rjkg,"Penix has an injury history he's only been healthy for 1 season in 5, imo not draftable outside of round 3.

I'll give you another name to look at, Shedeur Sanders son of Deion sanders. Now he may not choose to enter this years draft but he might and if he does he'd be the defacto 3rd best QB. Now his biggest drawbacks are that he has 19 career fumbles (but then he was also playing for jackson state I believe so it could have been a center/oline issue), he also does not have a cannon arm like a levis and in fact his deep ball might not be nfl calliber at all... BUT at short, and medium range he is deadly with a high completion percentage and low career int count. He also has excellent instincts and can feel pressure with high athleticism in the pocket. 

He's not a sexy QB compared to Caleb or Maye (who I do believe we have a shot at even if unlikely) but he's not a bad choice either, and at the time of the draft next year he'll be 22 with an NFL pedigree, I think he'd be a very reliable option.

Also this year he jumped to Colorado and his first game was against TCU which isn't a bad school, he threw for 500+ yards, 4 tds, no ints, and 80+% completion percentage and didn't have the rushing game to rely on they only got 55 rushing yards.",RyokoKnight,2023-09-26 01:00:26,16s5rbl

Sanders is I guy I‚Äôve been really interested in and I don‚Äôt think he enters the draft this year though. I think he‚Äôll wait a extra year so the team can build more so that he can be drafted higher and has a better shot at the Heisman.

Of course though that‚Äôs if Malik and Levis still look like they need to improve cause I wouldn‚Äôt waste the pick on him in 2025 NFL draft though if Levis or Malik look good though cause at that point we should just continue building around one of the two of them.
Still for next draft I would take a guy like Joe Milton at the very end of the draft or a guy like KJ Jefferson or Jaylen Daniels in the middle of it this draft if we want a qb. 
Some guys who have impressed me though who could also drop and might be good someday are guys like Mikey Keene from Fresno state who‚Äôs been looking like great so far this season I think and Micheal Pratt from Tulane who‚Äôs looked good.

1183,hv57bcb,,"What impressed me about the Saints when they won their Superbowl: they could impose their will on opposing teams from every direction. They could run, pass, or play takeaway D at any given time, provided something wasn't working. That's who this team really reminded me of, provided they played to their full potential. The biggest difference was that Payton and his OC understood that, and adjusted accordingly. Ride the hot hand, keep doing what works, and we have at least two more playoff wins over the past two years.",Best-Dragonfruit-292,2022-02-01 15:42:00,shxscz

1187,hv57jtj,,"Greg Cosell on 3HL kinda said the same thing. Our run game and passing game are way too married to each other. To the point of which if something happens to one the other will struggle.



This is why I wanted Vrabel to look outside the family tree for help on the offensive side of the ball. Because the offense needed to evolve. Instead Todd Downing more or less tripled down on it. Before Derrick Henry got hurt he was on pace for 500+ touches. That's more than any period of the Arthur Smith/Matt Lafleur era.",FxDriver,2022-02-01 15:43:30,shxscz

And hes right. I said before the Bengals game that we may need to pass to set up the run. Take advantage of the 8 man boxes we see on first down. Then we throw an INT on our first play üòÜ",muddyklux,2022-02-02 03:25:37,shxscz

An NFL offence shouldn‚Äôt be running the same play in half a season let alone twice in a quarter. Our passing game is either terrible screen, PA, or desperate 3rd and long plays.

Two is we threw to Raymond who slipped. 

Three is we threw to NWI. 

Our play style calls for tight games.  Yes we should have some flexibility but you can‚Äôt switch from your regular season plan and just switch cuz it‚Äôs playoffs. We need some OOMPH I agree.

This is an awful take. Just awful. The Bengals offense is loaded with talent. Chase is a superstar already. Tee Higgins is an excellent player and could a number 1 on some teams. Joe Mixon is the most underrated running back in football. An easy top 5 who should see McCaffrey like usage with his catching ability. The defense isn‚Äôt star studded, but is a solid unit that showed more flexibility and play-making then the Bills who everyone fawns over.

1218,hv5nbop,hv5mbun,You‚Äôre right his ceiling is every game he‚Äôs played. Above average regular season. Below average in post season. Why is that?

Gameplaning for our offence must feel like a break for a DC. We run about a dozen plays with 9 of them being run plays. 

We could be an amazing offence if they just implemented this new revolutionary thing called an Audible. 

The run game is awesome and I love having an elite back but it‚Äôs no where near enough. What are we going to pay AJ brown $22 mil a year to get 1-5 targets a week?

I don‚Äôt see how any of reflects a ‚Äúbreak for a DC.‚Äù  We seem pretty good. Yes we lost to the super bowl bound team by 3 with 20 seconds left.  But overall seem like a good team.

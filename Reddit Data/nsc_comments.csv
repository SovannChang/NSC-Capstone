The refs were decent last night, our team was really struggling and behind a lot of plays which led to some players having to take a foul or make a risky challenge. Those type of games always make the ref look worse than it really was. 

Even if the refs are bad, you have to be able to overcome such situations.  Relying on a completely perfect game from your team and the refs isn‚Äôt sustainable.

Alex Muyl was called for passive offside during Hany's first-half goal during the Monterrey game, which is ridiculous...there's no way he had any impact on the goalkeeper, and he wasn't even close to the ball. But hey, it's up to the ref.",RestlessPhilosopher,2023-10-05 17:16:53,16zorux
168,k3lr090,k3lmru7,"[https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/offside/#offside-position](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/offside/#offside-position)

11.1 & 11.2

It is not an offence to be offsides. It is an offence if when in an offside position, you play the ball or force a defender to do so, or obstruct their ability to play the ball.

Being offsides and drawing defenders away does not constitute active involvement in the play, it is not listed as an offence in the rules. Zimmerman elected to stop marking him, which had the ball been played to him initially would've been the right decision. but because the man on the wing was so open that he could put in an immediate uncontested cross, it came back to bite zim in the ass. It's simply unfortunate for him, but it's a decision CBs have to make many times during every game.

Clear example of the same rule in effect: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phf453Ueu7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phf453Ueu7A)

(1st goal of the video)

&#x200B;

The referee ruled that Muyl forced the goalie to delay his dive by waiting to see if he headed it. That was not true, the goalie dove first and the ref got it wrong, but that was the interpretation of the rule (3rd dash of the 2nd bullet point on 11.2)",LFCs95,2023-10-05 17:41:33,16zorux

1. Gary Smith fucking sucks. All around. 

2. Hany is becoming too selfish and is wanting to play more as a #9 to than a #10. Could be Gary's shit tactic or Hany trying to chase awards.


3. Midfield is a huge negative factor. This team already relies too much on the counters with the fullbacks but can't do shit without our best fullback Shaq.


4. Surridge was everywhere except where he needed to be, which is playing up fucking top and waiting for service from Hany or the wingers.

If the rulebook clearly proves me wrong, that's fine and I'm always open to learning new things (feel free to quote it if you can find it), but everything I've read and understood about it makes the definition of a ""passive"" player pretty subjective based on the circumstance.

11.1 & 11.2

It is not an offence to be offsides. It is an offence if when in an offside position, you play the ball or force a defender to do so, or obstruct their ability to play the ball.

Being offsides and drawing defenders away does not constitute active involvement in the play, it is not listed as an offence in the rules. Zimmerman elected to stop marking him, which had the ball been played to him initially would've been the right decision. but because the man on the wing was so open that he could put in an immediate uncontested cross, it came back to bite zim in the ass. It's simply unfortunate for him, but it's a decision CBs have to make many times during every game.

Even if the refs are bad, you have to be able to overcome such situations.  Relying on a completely perfect game from your team and the refs isn‚Äôt sustainable.

If the rulebook clearly proves me wrong, that's fine and I'm always open to learning new things (feel free to quote it if you can find it), but everything I've read and understood about it makes the definition of a ""passive"" player pretty subjective based on the circumstance.

168,k3lr090,k3lmru7,"[https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/offside/#offside-position](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/offside/#offside-position)

11.1 & 11.2

It is not an offence to be offsides. It is an offence if when in an offside position, you play the ball or force a defender to do so, or obstruct their ability to play the ball.

Being offsides and drawing defenders away does not constitute active involvement in the play, it is not listed as an offence in the rules. Zimmerman elected to stop marking him, which had the ball been played to him initially would've been the right decision. but because the man on the wing was so open that he could put in an immediate uncontested cross, it came back to bite zim in the ass. It's simply unfortunate for him, but it's a decision CBs have to make many times during every game.

Clear example of the same rule in effect: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phf453Ueu7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phf453Ueu7A)

(1st goal of the video)

&#x200B;

The referee ruled that Muyl forced the goalie to delay his dive by waiting to see if he headed it. That was not true, the goalie dove first and the ref got it wrong, but that was the interpretation of the rule (3rd dash of the 2nd bullet point on 11.2)",LFCs95,2023-10-05 17:41:33,16zorux

1. Gary Smith fucking sucks. All around. 

2. Hany is becoming too selfish and is wanting to play more as a #9 to than a #10. Could be Gary's shit tactic or Hany trying to chase awards.


3. Midfield is a huge negative factor. This team already relies too much on the counters with the fullbacks but can't do shit without our best fullback Shaq.


4. Surridge was everywhere except where he needed to be, which is playing up fucking top and waiting for service from Hany or the wingers.

I like to give the benefit of the doubt for players who fall down though as we've all seen, heard, or been around, the crowd generally doesn't. It's probably a bad case of groupthink which you see at any sporting event. People see anything as a possible malintentioned threat to their team's success whether it's ""refs always bias against them"" or every opposing player is diving/embellishing. What's unfortunate is that it's practically ingrained in sport-watching/fandom culture. The only times I've seen people not boo was when it was clear to everyone that the player was severely injured (i.e. paramedics and a stretcher) which is abysmal but par of course for a lot of crowds. It shouldn't happen but it's likely to continue just because of the sheer number of people who participate in it, many without even thinking.",Zheguez,2022-09-06 04:01:59,x5b9ma

They have no other opportunity to recover from anything, not to mention maybe they‚Äôll get a free kick out of it.

Now a critique: Speedway and its contributors have, in recent weeks, been increasingly sanctimonious towards the rest of us fans, especially the reddit brigade.

Most working musicians will have a whole black-out section in their closets. So in that respect, it was a killer move for the club.

Yes, Johnny Cash is a legendary figure here, we all know and respect that. That said, it should be clear that the man himself wasn't involved with the club, soccer in the city, and other connections to him (the opening claps and the 1st tifo) to warrant this are optimistic at best.

It‚Äôs not that no bench players have had good games (they have) it‚Äôs that when the line up is significantly rotated (which has been rare so far, but we can‚Äôt continue on like this all year) the entire unit performs much worse. Attack becomes less incisive, defense not up to our normal drilled selves.

My initial question (however in artfully) in the post was trying to look at the issue of relying on rotating the line up the way we are right now and perhaps for the first time in our short history.

The difference in quality after modest rotation shouldn‚Äôt be this dire, Gary knows and hopefully can come up with some tactical adjustments to help solve for it. I‚Äôd like to know if we have anyone besides Mukhtar and Leal are capable of setting up runs through the middle or springing effective counters. Attacks that funnel through listless crosses to outnumbered strikers just aren‚Äôt going to get you very far.

On defense, we need better communication and physicality with Walker off the pitch. Those are thing you always want more of, but it‚Äôs too noticeably worse without him.",DoctorPhalanx73,2022-05-16 17:23:07,uqi435

Haakenson, Washington, Loba, etc need guys like Zimmerman/Romney, Dax, and Hany to really perform. When you take every single core player out, it can fall apart. Like it did. Idk wtf was up w Dax that game‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like he wasn‚Äôt on the field. So abnormal. I think it‚Äôs more of a matter of our regularly starting non-core players like Muyl, Maher, Davis, etc becoming confident enough to really be leaders when the core is tired.

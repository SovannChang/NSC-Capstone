Side rant: why can't we play without blaming the refs for everything? Yeah, this post is me blaming the refs for fucking up a call. But I mean the players. Teal with an unnecessary yellow after the game was over because he kept complaining. I have no doubt that Lovitz's 2nd yellow was because he chirped something at the ref at some point. I get that we get penalized a shit ton, but why do the boys let the ref get under their skin and dictate the way we play. If we don't get the calls in the first 25 minutes, we don't do well.

Time wasting? Blatant repeated faking? Diving? Boo to your golden hearts‚Äô content. But stop booing every time an opposing player goes down.

Drawing fouls and taking a moment to recover from even a minor collision are part of the game bc there is no other time to do it.

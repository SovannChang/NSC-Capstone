2,172qpfd,Preseason and gurianov,"I spent part of this evening looking at preseason line combination TOI together to try and guess what starting lines could look like, and the following guys played significant time together:

Forsberg-ROR

Tomasino-Novak-Evangelista

Nyquist-Glass

Sissons-Trenin

Parssinen, Sherwood and to an extent Smith and Evangelista seemed to float around the lines a bit more.

Fagemo still in the air, but ROR and with Nyquist-Parssinen.

Gurianov played lots of minutes with the ROR and Glass combos, which has me really baffled what was going on to put him on waivers at this point. Any thoughts on what we were hoping with this guy? I’m guessing hopes of a new spark and some scoring infusion…. Maybe a lack of chemistry? Style?

8,171kr9k,Too Many Men,"I was at the game last night and couldn't understand the rationale behind the too many men penalty. At first it looked like an offsetting penalty that should've been 5 on 5? And then Carolina took 2 more penalties. So 5 v 3. (At this point I was pretty sure it should've been 4 v 2 but the refs didn't catch it). 

Then they called too many men on Nashville and made it 4v3 and let 2 guys out of the box during a commercial break. 

Did the announcers figure out what was happening? It seems like the refs got turned around. There was no explanation given on ice.",GMBarryTrotz,2023-10-06 19:03:20

0,8io3tf,JetsBros here - mad props to the fans that stood by their team to the very end,"Nothing makes me more upset then to see “fans” leave before the team skates off the ice or worse ... before the final whistle.

When the Jets were about to be swept by the Ducks the fans still cheered them on right to the end, during the handshake and as they left the ice. I loved seeing the Preds fans that stuck around to do that for their team. Because the players appreciate it and will remember it.

Predators are a great team and have a loud barn like us. It sucks that this wasn’t a conference final like it should be. Having the #1 and #2 teams in the league meet in Round 2 is silly.

I tip my hat to both the true fans and the team itself for a crazy unpredictable series. It was a clash of titans that made the analyst scratch their heads because they never knew what would happen next. 

Stats, trends, history or experience. All thrown out the window.

John Hynes, I won’t waste breath on you. You’re nothing but a goddamn clown who shuffled lines like a deck of cardsOH AH AAAH! BALD! BALD! BALD! MY EYES!!!!

Dan Muse, your special teams results are just as bad as McCarthy’s.

David Poile, don’t think you’re out of the woods either. You’re so Defense-focused that you have totally FAILED to develop any sort of offensive presence. Every time you’ve acquired a forward, you’ve fucked him up. When you haven’t had a 40-goal scorer in your franchise’s entire history, that’s a sign you’re a fucking failure of a GM.

If we miss the playoffs this year, with this much so-called “talent”, that’s a failure of management. Such a failure only has one solution: WHOLESALE PURGE. You ARENT winning a Cup with this lazy, underachieving, PATHETIC core.",Strider755,2020-03-04 04:41:50
6,r9i2bo,Is the Stadium Series jersey design growing on anyone else? Or just me?,"I initially hated the Stadium Series jerseys, but I’m softening up on them a bit now. The color scheme is fantastic. That navy blue is perfect. “Smashville” is a little cringey and I’d prefer no words with the Winter Classic cat or a larger guitar pick on the front. “Preds” would have been fine with that font if words were mandatory. 

I think it’s  frustrating that this could have been a lot better, but it’s not terrible. I’m not paying full price, but I will pick one up on the clearance rack.",Over-One-8,2021-12-05 15:30:07
7,c585mq,Corey Perry (and why I think Poile should sign him),"We all know Perry from all of our Anaheim series, and most of us hated him. I wouldn't call him dirty (ala kesler), but more of a troll that can get under peoples skin easily.

With that aside, hate him or not, its a pretty low risk high reward situation with Perry. If Poile can sign him for 1-2x1, I think he should. He has been on a decline with his knee injury bolstering that, however even on a crappy Ducks team, playing bottom six minutes (last season), he produced 10 points in 31 games. Now, clearly that is quite bad, however if he plays 62 games (if he doesnt get hurt/take games off it could be more) He could net anywhere from 15-30 points (leaning closer to 30 imo). Compared to guys who usually play bottom 6 minutes, hes pretty equal if not better. He would easily replace Salamaki, who is clearly worse, putting up 7 in 37 games this year. If you want a comparable in terms of points, I think he will land somewhere near Calle Jarnkrok (26 points in 79gp). 

If Poile can sign Perry on a cheap, one year deal, I think it is worth it, regardless of how much we've loathed him in the past. Who knows, maybe he has a really good year and puts up ~40 or something. He's easily better than FreddyG and Salamaki, and brings some attitude and grit, which we could use since Subban is gone.

8,72vxy5,Anthem protests?,"Do we think there will be any protesting going on during the anthem this hockey season? Sorry if this is a hot topic, but I'd like to know how brushed up on my free speech constitutional law cases I need to be when I host watch parties.",TwitchN,2017-09-27 22:43:40
9,146jzov,Go Vegas,"I went into this series pretty neutral. Would be cool to see Vegas win it and it would be neat to see Florida win it from the 8th seed.

But this Florida team has really just played dirty this whole finals.

I really want to see Vegas take game 5 and hoist the cup at home.

Let these Florida goons play some golf, maybe their fans can go watch them and throw trash on the greens.",Shrabster33,2023-06-11 04:06:19

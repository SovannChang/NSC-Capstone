242,181gqsv,Why I'm iffy on Brock Bowers,"I've seen a lot of people talking about what the Titans should do if MHJ and the top left tackles aren't available when they draft. A lot of people have been saying that Bowers would be a great option to give Levis a weapon who will also be a good blocker.

While I like the idea of Brock Bowers,  drafting a tight end in the first round hasn't worked out great for nearly every team since Greg Olson in 2007. *I'll preface this by saying I'm going solely off offensive statistics like catches, TDS, and yards - and not blocking. I just think if a TE is to be drafted this high, they need to be a great pass catcher.*

2021 - Kyle Pitts - Had a really good rookie season in terms of yards, but has not been looking great since, but may be too soon to tell . (maybe it's scheme? coaching?)

2019 - T.J. Hockenson - pretty solid, but 1st round talent, especially top 10? 

2019 - Noah Fant - decent, but not making any waves.

2018 - O.J. Howard - even had Tom Brady for a couple years and was an average TE at BEST. Big disappointment considering the hype.

2017 - Evan Engram - good rookie season but that has been his peak.

2017 - David Njoku - fine at best. Hasn't had 700 yards or more than 4 TDs in a season

2014 - Eric Ebron - one really good season that came in year 5 - 13 TDs and 66 catches (both career highs by far).

2013 - Tyler Eifert - only 1 season with over 500 yards and/or 5 TDs and they came in the same year. Crushed it with 13 TDs.

Hindsight is 20/20, but would you spend a 1st on any of these players? Especially with the shape of our roster?

The best tight ends in the league like Kelce, Kittle, Andrews, etc., were pretty much all drafted in rounds 3 or later. Not trying to say you can't get a good tight end in round one, but it's a big gamble. Nearly every year there seems to be a consensus top TE, and nearly every year they don't live up to the hype of a first round pick.

With the holes that we have on this team, are you comfortable gambling on a tight end in the first round?",villageshoemaker,2023-11-22 18:57:53,"[('miscellaneous conversations around player drafts', -0.03)]"

It's this look. This look on his face, every time the camera shows a close-up of him each week. This look like he's surrounded by idiots and he's in utter disbelief of how any of this can happen. You know it, you've seen it so often now, he barely moves due to the supposed incompetence of others. 

When he first joined this team, this was a look reserved for dumb calls by the refs. He freezes, staring, not moving, with a face like he's either in deep pain or about too fart. ""I can't believe what I'm seeing"", ""Why do I have to deal with this?!"", ""Amateurs!"". At the time I liked it, it could really show distain without needing to scream at the refs, as they screwed stuff up.

Now, it's every game, every other play, defense and offense. A look of shock like it's a complete surprise to him the team is bad, that he's been a part of leading them to this place.

Why does it piss me off so much?

It's because, as a player, how could you play for this expression? How can you give it your all, when you're already struggling and looking for guidance, after looking to the sideline and seeing this staring back at you? This frozen glare of dumbfound disbelief from the man who is supposed to be guiding you, teaching you, helping you.

I couldn't play for a leader who has given up, I don't get how anybody on this team can. We're not a strong team, a deep team, there are so many problems, but nobody is even close to being lifted beyond their level by this guy, as all he has to offer them is this stupid face. 

It's time for a leader, this one has checked out. He's decided he deserves better than idiots.    ",AntlPop80,2023-11-20 22:16:42,"[('player performance', -0.39)]"

325,17x25is,Does Jeff Fisher get too much blame for Vince Young flaming out?,"Whenever I see anything related to Vince Young a common sentiment among fans is that it was Fisher's fault. That Jeff Fisher did not like Vince and actively wanted the guy to fail. I know that Vince was forced onto Jeff by Bud Adams and that he wanted a different qb. They butted heads alot and there were lots of moments where things came to a head like that scare in 08 after Vince got benched and of course  Young throwing his pads into the stands. I know Fisher isn't without fault but what about Vince?

Vince Young was an extremely gifted athlete. He can turn nothing into something and had at multiple times took control of games by himself. He is front and center on a few of my favorite moments in Titans history. However he wasn't the brightest, scoring only a 6 on the wonderlic which is one of the lowest scores ever. An Nfl playbook is pretty complicated and so is reading defenses. Vince struggled with both. He was also known to lack a strong work ethic. Not Jamarcus Russel bad but not the kind of work ethic you expect out of a franchise qb. 

In games he struggled to be a consistent passer regularly throwing duds and at times pretty confusing passes. A lot of that could be attributed to his unique throwing motion which never got coached out of him. After leaving Tennessee he played for few other teams not even able to make the final roster on most of them before his career just quietly ended. 

Vy was an amazing athlete but I don't think he had the mental necessary to play qb. Had history been different and he went to a different system would he have became the star everyone saw in him after the rose bowl game? I don't think so. What do you guys think? Especially those who watched during that era.

Maybe at Liberty, playing at that level of college ball, he looked like a Lamar-esque QB but I haven’t seen a trace of that with his snaps in the NFL. 

He has trouble letting the ball fly which you don’t want from an NFL qb to begin with, but if he was making plays with his legs it would be somewhat forgivable, but he doesn’t. He generally looks like one of the slowest people on the field. He’s not juking anyone out of their shoes. He’s not breaking big runs when protection fails (which is far too often).

1259,ut6189,Dregs of the off season post. 2021 QB draft class hypothetical.,"So, we've reached that point in the offseason where there's only the most absurd hypotheticals are discussed. Let's jump 3 years forward.

Where do you think the members of the 2021 QB draft class are? Where do they end up? Any of them you think hit free agency? 

I think in all likelihood, Lawrence will be, at worst, a top half qb that could perform better with talent, and probably isn't going anywhere. 

Jones is probably in New England to stay, and what are the odds they'll have a shot at a better qb? 

Haven't seen anything good from trey Lance, and honestly Davis Mills is probably better than him right now, based off film.

Haven't seen enough from Wilson, but he's good enough to beat us, apparently.

I think it's totally possible the Bears mismanage Justin Fields and he ends up available. Could be interesting.

At this point, unless Tannehill has some sort of resurgence with zero injuries of any kind and banishes all his post-season demons, he won't be on the team. It won't make sense to tie up that much of the cap with a middling qb on the downslide. So let's say tanny gets this year and next and is let go. 

Malik has a year and is meh. Maybe Tua's numbers last year, VY's rookie season-ish. WOW plays, but a probably unsustainable completion percentage. Lots of 'if he can do x better then maybe?' posts. 

We might have ammo to move around high in the draft in this scenario, but let's say it's a dominant defense, mediocre offense, bad division scenario that gets you 9 wins and a barely-missed playoff or 1st round thumping and a draft pick at 17-20.",DayTerrors,2022-05-19 15:32:57,"[('lawrence', 0.8), ('jones', 0.6), ('lance', -0.5), ('mills', 0.3), ('wilson', 0.5), ('justin fields', -0.2), ('tannehill', -0.6), ('malik', 0.1), ('tua', 0.1), ('defense', 0.6), ('offense', -0.2), ('injuries', -0.6), ('ammo', 0.2), ('high draft', 0.4), ('exxonmobilpartyfowl oiler-titans', 0.3), ('afc andromeda division', 0.5), ('robot takeover', -0.4), ('half man/half cheetah', -0.2), ('al davis', 0.2), ('farmers only', 0.1), ('step-bro division', 0.1), ('high school talent', 0.4), ('trade up', 0.2), ('day-day parker-watts-johnson', 0.6), ('miss patsys tynee tykes daycare', 0.7), ('milk and animal crackers', 0.1), ('over-hyped prospect', -0.2), ('superbowls', 0.4), ('104.5 the zone', 0.4), ('insults', -0.4)]"

1442,ubnifj,The Case for a 1st Round QB,"* **JRob's 1st Round MO has been to take Home Run Swings on 1st Round Picks with MAJOR risk/reward potential**

Caleb Farley - top 10 talent but injured and sat out final season for COVID

Isaiah Wilson - Equally young, large, talented, and immature

Jeffrey Simmons - Top 10 talent but injured and character concerns

Rashaan Evans - Modern big play LB but not sound in fits/tackling/coverage

Corey Davis - Height/weight/speed guy but G5 School product

Adoree Jackson - Undersized burner with return potential with injury concerns

Jack Conklin - Maybe the only exception to this concept as he came in as a steady, high ceiling OT

Taking a QB at any point in the 1st round is the ultimate risk/reward HR Swing

* **Post June 1 2023 Release of Tannehill saves $27 million against the cap** ([https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/tennessee-titans/ryan-tannehill-9818/](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/tennessee-titans/ryan-tannehill-9818/))

This is of particular of importance because the entire 2019 Titans Draft Class (Simmons, AJB, Nate Davis, Hooker, David Long) hits FA following the 2022 season. Tannehill's $27 million would go a long way in re-signing these guys.

Quote from Jon Robinson during his post-season interview: ""You’re trying to get younger, you’re trying to get less expensive, you’re trying to do all that. That’s no secret. 32 teams are trying to do the same thing: trying to get as young and as cheap on the roster as possible as you can on the roster because it gives you staying power in the National Football League. ""

* **The 2022 QB Class offers the Titans a unique opportunity to get a top-3 QB in the Class**

It is rare for a team with the record of success the Titans have had during JRob's tenure to have the opportunity to get one of the top-3 QBs in a class. For context:

2021 - QBs went 1,2,3 

2020 - Joe Burrow, Tua, and Justin Herbert went 1,5,6 

2019 - The late Dwayne Haskins was the 3rd QB off the board at pick 15

2018 - Josh Allen was the 3rd QB off the board at pick 7

2017 - Deshaun Watson was the 3rd QB off the board at pick 12

2016 - Paxton Lynch (ugh) was the 3rd QB off the board at 26

In short, it has been 6 years since the 3rd QB in a draft class made it to pick 26. With a 4-year playoff streak alive - the Titans don't appear to be in position to make a selection in the top half of the draft any time soon. 

In short, 2022 offers the Titans a unique opportunity to get a top-3 QB for incredibly cheap who can allow the Titans to re-sign key members of the roster to expand their contending window to 2023 and beyond.",DSFIGHT42,2022-04-25 15:18:02,"[('pricing and the impact of ticket prices on stadium atmosphere', -0.04)]"

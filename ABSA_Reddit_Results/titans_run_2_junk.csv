325,17x25is,Does Jeff Fisher get too much blame for Vince Young flaming out?,"Whenever I see anything related to Vince Young a common sentiment among fans is that it was Fisher's fault. That Jeff Fisher did not like Vince and actively wanted the guy to fail. I know that Vince was forced onto Jeff by Bud Adams and that he wanted a different qb. They butted heads alot and there were lots of moments where things came to a head like that scare in 08 after Vince got benched and of course  Young throwing his pads into the stands. I know Fisher isn't without fault but what about Vince?

Vince Young was an extremely gifted athlete. He can turn nothing into something and had at multiple times took control of games by himself. He is front and center on a few of my favorite moments in Titans history. However he wasn't the brightest, scoring only a 6 on the wonderlic which is one of the lowest scores ever. An Nfl playbook is pretty complicated and so is reading defenses. Vince struggled with both. He was also known to lack a strong work ethic. Not Jamarcus Russel bad but not the kind of work ethic you expect out of a franchise qb. 

In games he struggled to be a consistent passer regularly throwing duds and at times pretty confusing passes. A lot of that could be attributed to his unique throwing motion which never got coached out of him. After leaving Tennessee he played for few other teams not even able to make the final roster on most of them before his career just quietly ended. 

Vy was an amazing athlete but I don't think he had the mental necessary to play qb. Had history been different and he went to a different system would he have became the star everyone saw in him after the rose bowl game? I don't think so. What do you guys think? Especially those who watched during that era. I was 8 when Vince got drafted so my memory on that era of the Titans isn't razor sharp.",Titan5005,2023-11-17 00:28:23,"[('vince young', 0.21), ('jeff fisher', -0.29), ('football intelligence', -0.13), ('work ethic', -0.13)]"

552,17mn4ic,"Guys we aren't firing Vrabel, drop it.","It is delusional to think we are firing a coach most of the the league outside of our dipshit fanbase thinks is good. The truth is he's coaching a bad team, that's right I said it.

We are a bad team because we are talent deprived with many of our starters being UDFA's they said as much at the start of this game. We are missing about 3x 1 round picks on this team and several 2nd and 3rd round pick level talent that should be filling out those roles... but the best we have is UDFA's because Jrob absolutely fucked this team with horribly risky picks that we are now paying a talent deficit on.

Its very easy to blame coaches (I myself blame Tim Kelly for tonight for the cowardly play calling in the 4th) but we must also remember we are still the same talent starved team we were when we started the season... a season where we hoped our DL would pull us through games because our offense was so anemic. It is clear now, they simply aren't good enough to win games on their own and even though I again blame Kelly for this loss he's essentially calling up plays one handed... our line barely holds an edge, our WR's are mediocre outside of DHop, TE's are basically no shows... we are limited by our talent and that forces very 1 dimensional low risk play calls like screens plays (which do work but obviously lose their effectiveness if we are running it every fresh set of downs because we don't have anything better).

Next season will be better... we have a shit ton of cap to pull in talent in FA... Ran's picks this year leave a lot of hope that we have a similar draft to fill out some of these holes on our roster with young talent.  Also on a positive note Levis seems to be elevating our receivers beyond what they have performed in the last 2 seasons... and that bodes well when we have ACTUAL talent worth a damn (not named Dhop).",RyokoKnight,2023-11-03 04:39:05,"[('vrabel', -0.12), ('coaching', 0.16), ('team', -0.17), ('offense', -0.17), ('game', -0.28), ('talent', -0.07), ('kelly', -0.04), ('plays', -0.05), ('loss', -0.03), ('hiring', -0.07), ('offensive staff', -0.13)]"

But my question is: does losing Byard actually move the needle that much with respect to whether or not we win or lose games? Obviously difficult to determine the impact of his absence until we watch the upcoming games, but I'm curious why it seems like the majority of fans and media are acting like losing a single player will automatically tank the rest of our season?

Personally my hunch would be that Ran is playing a bit of moneyball and has analytics that suggest replacing a top safety with an okay safety won't have that much of an impact on the current season, and will give us resources for next season. That said, KB was obviously more than just a top safety‚Äîhe was directing the defense and helping call out plays and coverages, etc.

Where do you think the members of the 2021 QB draft class are? Where do they end up? Any of them you think hit free agency? 

I think in all likelihood, Lawrence will be, at worst, a top half qb that could perform better with talent, and probably isn't going anywhere. 

Jones is probably in New England to stay, and what are the odds they'll have a shot at a better qb? 

Haven't seen anything good from trey Lance, and honestly Davis Mills is probably better than him right now, based off film.

Haven't seen enough from Wilson, but he's good enough to beat us, apparently.

I think it's totally possible the Bears mismanage Justin Fields and he ends up available. Could be interesting.

At this point, unless Tannehill has some sort of resurgence with zero injuries of any kind and banishes all his post-season demons, he won't be on the team. It won't make sense to tie up that much of the cap with a middling qb on the downslide. So let's say tanny gets this year and next and is let go. 

Malik has a year and is meh. Maybe Tua's numbers last year, VY's rookie season-ish. WOW plays, but a probably unsustainable completion percentage. Lots of 'if he can do x better then maybe?' posts. 

We might have ammo to move around high in the draft in this scenario, but let's say it's a dominant defense, mediocre offense, bad division scenario that gets you 9 wins and a barely-missed playoff or 1st round thumping and a draft pick at 17-20.",DayTerrors,2022-05-19 15:32:57,"[('lawrence performance', 0.6), ('jones in new england', 0.32), ('trey lance performance', -0.32), ('davis mills performance', 0.38), ('zach wilson performance', 0.25), ('justin fields management', -0.18), ('tannehill performance and management', -0.22), ('malik performance', -0.13), ('farmers only step-bro division', 0.3), ('day-day parker-watts-johnson', 0.12), ('tynee tykes daycare', 0.48)]"

1351,127ee0i,Robert Woods stitched jersey?,"Hi all, British Rams fan, but most importantly Robert Woods fan here.

I was gutted when he left the Rams but really hoped things would work out in Tennessee. Alas it was not to be.

I was wondering if anyone knows, was there ever a stitched version of a Titans Robert Woods jersey? 

Would love to grab one but the only ones I can see are the printed ones.

As a side note, I enjoyed watching the Titans this season as a secondary fan, I know things didn't all go great but think there's still a lot of reasons to feel positive like Burks, and have a lot of respect for Vrabel.

1418,11t9oia,Should the Titans seriously consider making Llamar Jackson an offer?,"I didn't even seriously consider this until about 3 days ago.  I was very surprised when the Ravens put the unrestricted tag on him and had been expected them to inevitably come to a long term deal with him.  As it stands,  it seems to me that Llamar wants a top contract in the NFL and the Ravens don't believe: A) that he is worth it ; B) that another team will give it to him (in addition to two 1st Rd Picks).

DONT DO IT:

1) Tannehill vs Lamar the last few years are very similar.  The side by side stats are for the most part the same.  How much of an upgrade is it really?

2) LJ has missed a ton of games the last 2 years.  Injuries have been an issue for him and with his style of play there is no guarantee he will available enough to warrant a monster contract. 

3)  Its time for the Titans offense to enter the new era of offense (10 years later).  Bringing in LJ is the opposite direction most of us were hoping the offensive play calling to go and would all but guarantee we remain at the top of the league with percentage of plays we run the ball.  

4)  Not much post season success.  Most of his allure comes from regular season success and he has underperformed in the games that matter most.  

5) Two 1st Rd picks are very valuable, especially at #11 overall.  That combined with the his cap hit, it will be difficult to build talent at other positions.

DO IT:

1)  LJ is currently 6th in odds to win the MVP next year.  He already has an MVP under his belt.  We are talking about a player who the general public believes takes a team to another level.  

2) Tannehill had his window.  While many of us believe Tannehill has played in the top tier since he has been a Titan, most NFL fans have stead fast thinking we are not a real contender with him at the helm.  Henry carried us through his first playoff run,  He choked his second year and was able to play this year.  Im good with giving him another chance but I'm ready to move on.  

3)  It gives us the best chance to win this year.  It's hard to argue we are contenders right now, and the sports book's have us as a bottom 5 team.  If we bring in LJ we go from bottom 5 to top 12 overnight.  It would only take 3-0 before EVERYONE would have us in the top 5.

4)  We are not going to have very good receiving options this year.  Burks and Chig have big potential but even if they both have great years its still a weakness.  FA pool is dry and it sounds like a weak position for this years draft.  Even if its a priority to improve this area, its hard to see this group as being a plus.  

5)  Read option with LJ and Henry would be ELECTRIC.  The expectation for me would be to have to most combined rushing yards for 2 players on one team of ALL time.  For a defender that has to read whether LJ is going to keep of hand it to Henry, there is no way they could cover both.  Explosive runs all day. 

Conclusion:

My overall thoughts are that I'm am very hesitant because it seems like a boom or bust.  Could lead to immediate contention and a Championship in the next few years or could cripple the cap and draft capital and bring back dark days.  My interest in Llamar came out of nowhere a couple days ago, and the more I think about it, the more I feel like this is the best landing spot for him.

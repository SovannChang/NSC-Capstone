904,10y0gce,My ONLY defense of the octagon,"I hate the octagon in our crest. As best as I can gather, it's only part of it because it represented the footprint of [the first design of our stadium](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/09/20/nashville-mls-stadium-construction-contract/1366972002/). I'm hopeful that someday I can buy a jersey where the crest is just the soundwave N, but the [Johnny Cash promo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoXzy9sO3W_/) at Bicentennial Mall makes me think it's not going anywhere any time soon.

But now I think I have one little, tiny defense of the octagon?

I pointed out the similarities between our soundwave N and FC Nantes' new crest (as of 2019) to a friend of mine, which led me to this graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tq0r7evp67ha1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=4721d5832eb93dc10da6ad3ea64d0cc4bdcb0b90

The first two FC Nantes crests were contained in octagons. Then, I found out that Stade Rennais FC's crest [adopted their own octagon in 1997](https://1000logos.net/rennais-logo/). My search was in no way exhaustive, but I couldn't *easily* find any other uses of octagons in soccer other than these two French clubs. Which leads to my defense.

The city of Nashville has a little bit of French history, with the area having been used by French fur traders right before Robertson, Donelson, et al. arrived to set up what would eventually become the city. That history is acknowledged on the city seal in a *fleur de lis*—an element that was part of [the old Nashville FC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_FC) crest years ago, as well. Although the French element was removed from the seal for the USL team's identity, perhaps people like me who have strong, negative feelings about the octagon can retcon it—in our minds, anyway—as a distinctly French element that pays homage to Nashville's little bit of French history.

At least until we can finally drop it for good.",nodgih,2023-02-09 17:26:41,"[('octagon', -0.88), ('crest', 0.04), ('stadium', 0.05), ('footprint', 0.0), ('jersey', 0.0), ('johnny cash promo', -0.07), ('graphic', 0.0), ('french history', 0.33), ('seal of nashville', 0.0), ('intonot', -0.15), ('fleur de lis', 0.33), ('nashville fc', -0.08), ('fc nantes', 0.18), ('stade rennais fc', 0.0), ('soccer', 0.0), ('nashville', 0.0), ('nashvillians', 0.0), ('closer to french exploration history', 0.02), ('new orleans', 0.0), ('detroit', 0.0), ('st. louis', 0.0), ('nantes changed their logo', 0.04), ('juventus', 0.0), ('crest on the shirt', 0.0), ('rules by mls', 0.0), ('juventus', 0.0), ('montreal', 0.0), ('chicago', 0.0), ('austin', 0.0), ('logo', -0.04), ('merch', 0.0), ('mls', 0.0), ('atlantic', 0.0), ('charlotte', 0.0), ('fleur de lis on the compass rose on the nashville seal', 0.0), ('club colors', 0.06), ('seal of nashville sports a fleur de lis', 0.0), ('new logo of rocket league', 0.0), ('esports logo', 0.0)]"

1029,xszk0m,Idea for fan engagement at games!,"I watch a lot of Italian, and German football, and something hit me this morning as I was watching the Serie A. We should have our PA announcer “hype up” the crowd by starting one of Chants that the supporter section is doing, joining the supporter section, or even something as simple as after a goal having the crowd finish a phrase he/she says. I’ve noticed that GEODIS isn’t always as loud as it should be during most points in a match(except when we score a goal obviously). I think it would add to the atmosphere of the stadium, engage more of the crowd, and in turn motivate the players just that tad bit more. I know this isn’t totally common in America outside of the NBA(PA saying “defense”), but I’d like to think we could always be a little more intimidating as a crowd, and I think this is a good way to start.

1034,vlz6vm,Opinions on NSC making political statements?,"Seeing a lot of tweets from NSC fans as well as other clubs fans expressing anger that the club hasn't yet put out a statement concerning the recent SCOTUS decision. I'm not trying to start a political discourse here but only comment in regards to the response from the club. I'm not sure I understand the expectation from fans that the sports club they support be required to make public statements or press releases for every major political development. I'm certainly not in the ""keep politics out of sports,"" mindset, and I have no issue with a club making a statement if/when they choose,  but I also don't expect the team to have to make its opinion known everytime something controversial happens in politics. That is a lose-lose for the team in many ways. No matter what side you fall on, the team would be alienating fans for their political beliefs one way or the other.

116,11xp8nm,Oilers fan here in peace. Ekholm is an Absolute Stud,"As an Oilers fan, I had always known that Ekholm was a pretty good defenceman. I remember always trading for or signing him in NHL franchise mode and putting him on the second pairing as a good shutdown defenceman and being pretty happy with the results. But I didn‚Äôt expect him to come to E-town and be a goddamn stud. 

First and foremost, he has come in and completely stabilized the Oilers back end. He not only eats about 25 minutes a night and reduces the amount of ice time put on the other defencemen, but there has been a general effect on improving the defensive responsibility of the blue line as a whole. Evan Bouchard, who he has been partnered with since day 1, has completely taken off offensively and looks way more confident defensively. Not to mention other young dmen like Philip Broberg and Vincent Desharnais have looked way more calm and confident. 

As an added bonus, he has been a point-per-game player and has injected so much life into the offence. He had the game saving tying goal last night on a beauty of a clapper below the hash marks. This is just one example of how he seems to always know when to cheat for offence, and is never caught pinching at the wrong time.
Just one of many cases where he seemingly never makes an uncalculated error.

To be frank, I didn‚Äôt really know what to completely expect when we traded for him. He wasn‚Äôt really rumoured to go to Edmonton until a couple hours before he got traded. All of the rumours pointed to Chychrun or Gavrikov coming over. And admittedly, I was initially disappointed that we traded for Ekholm over Chychrun. But seeing how Ek has fit in seamlessly, I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything.

Oh, and did I mention that Viking beard and his enthusiasm for playing in this market and going for the cup ü§§.",ImprovementAlarmed44,2023-03-21 18:13:29,"[('team performance', 0.45), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.15), ('coaching and management', 0.08), ('miscellaneous', 0.45)]"

130,183omt4,Who is the Preds biggest rival right now?,"Was thinking about it this week. Over our team‚Äôs history, we‚Äôve usually had at least one or multiple teams that the fanbase, and the players to an extent, absolutely could not stand.

‚Ä¢ Detroit in the 2000s when they were in the Western Conf
‚Ä¢ Chicago in the 2010s during their dynasty era
‚Ä¢ Pittsburg & Winnipeg following the Cup run
‚Ä¢ Dallas around the Winter Classic and playoff series

A lot of these rivalries are based on two factors: 
1. These opponents being really good/Cup contenders 
2. The Preds being consistently able to compete and sometimes upset them.

These past few seasons, mainly under Hynes, I feel like the Preds team lost that edge and that bite that they were known for, but it seems with all of the youth and new staff that it‚Äôs coming back!

So who do y‚Äôall see as our current biggest rival? Any other reasons why our rivalries have lost that edge? Maybe it‚Äôs just a Covid hangover as well.

Also Saros can't be one for one for mcdavid or draisaitl so we will have to give up glass, or evangilista, or forsberg, or Novak, or fabbro. Doing this would leave us with two ahl goalies, 0 forward core depth, and a bland defense.

He's got 2 years left, we have Askarov coming up (probably around then), and our playoff outlook for the next two years is pretty slim so why hold onto such a high value piece?

Would be really painful to see him go but I think we could get some massive pieces for him and then we have Askarov to fill in behind him. Also, would be very sick to see Saros make a deep play with another team because he really has what it takes to pull a cup if he had a solid team in front of him.

204,17gi12x,Whatever happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators?-#23 Blair Atcheynum,"Blair Michael Atcheynum (born April 20, 1969, Estevan, Saskatchewan) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger. Atcheynum is of Cree descent.

Playing career

Atcheynum was selected in the third round, 52nd overall, by the Hartford Whalers in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft after scoring 70 goals in 71 games with the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League during the 1988‚Äì89 season. He never reached the NHL with the Whalers and was later claimed by the new Ottawa Senators in the 1992 NHL Expansion Draft.

He spent the majority of his career in the minor leagues but was able to break into the NHL for a total of 196 games over four seasons. He got his first taste of the NHL during the 1992‚Äì93 NHL season when he played four games for the Ottawa Senators, although he spent the majority of the season with their farm team, the New Haven Senators of the American Hockey League. It would take another four years to make it as a regular in the NHL. He played in 61 games (scoring a respectable 11 goals and 15 assists) during the 1997‚Äì98 NHL season for the St. Louis Blues after signing with the team as a free agent. The main reasoning behind Atcheynum being called up to the Blues during this period was due to the lack of depth on their roster early on in the 1997-98 season. With St. Louis, Atcheynum would typically play on a line with Craig Conroy and Scott Pellerin that was fondly referred to as the ""CPA Line"".

The next year he was selected in the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft by the newly formed Nashville Predators.He played 53 games with the Predators and had 8 goals and 6 assists before being traded back to St. Louis for a sixth-round draft pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. In 1999 he was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Blackhawks, with whom he played 66 games between 1999 and 2001. Atcheynum retired as a professional hockey player in 2001.

Atcheynum is currently an assistant coach with the Battlefords North Stars of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. He was also most recently honoured at the 2012 First Nation Games, alongside Fred Sasakamoose, who was the first treaty Indian to play in the NHL.",99titan,2023-10-25 23:08:52,"[('team performance', 0.14)]"

233,17a3kws,"Nashville D-Men ""Individual Event Maps"" plus advanced stats","With the discussion around Fabbro potentially being traded, I started to look into the stats behind each player from the Boston game. Obviously this is only one game, and it was special teams heavy, but it's still fun to dive in. 

This Individual Event Maps don't tell the whole story but they do help tell some story, especially about each player's role on the team. Note that an event is a shot, block hit, or give away / take away and it's recorded by a human, so it's somewhat unreliable (for example, some people are more generous with hits, etc), and a one game sample isn't particularly useful. That said... 

https://imgur.com/a/jldboUO

McDonagh - stay at home D who blocks shots.  
Josi - no defensive zone ""events"" - in fact, ALL of his offensive zone events are on the power play.  
Barrie - True to his legacy - offensive contributor both on special teams and 5v5. Very little (but all positive) defensive zone contribution.   
Lauzon - shades of McDonagh. Blocked lots of shots, laid lots of hits. Barely a wrong step.  
Carrier - Overall good game but not a ton of offensive zone events.  
Fabbro - apparently just a punching bag? Man he took a lot of hits. Worth noting this includes a lot of PK time, so you're going to face more shots and be fighting for pucks more than even strength. But he did share PK time with Lauzon, who seemed to be far better at delivering hits. 

Interesting other pairing notes: 

Even: Fabbro was generally paired with Josi, Carrier with McDonagh, and Lauzon and Barrie. 
 
PK: the first pairing was McDonagh and Carrier (they played the whole game together), second Fabbro with Lauzon. 

Power Play: Almost overwhelmingly Josi and Barrie played on the first PP unit. Carrier was the sole D for the 2nd. This is opposite of last year's PP system where Josi QB'd the first unit, and then we'd bring on 2 Dmen on the 2nd unit, presumably for better coverage to transition to even strength. 

The lines shifted in the 3rd once we gave up the 3rd goal, with Barrie shifted up with Josi and Fabbro sent to the 3rd line with Lauzon.

241,17802lv,"Elliotte Friedman: ""It would make a lot of sense for Vancouver to Trade Connor Garland to Nashville""","I am listening to the 32 Thoughts Podcast from October 13th.

Vancouver appears to be trying to trade Connor Garland. There are not a lot of teams with cap space. 

Friedman says that Vancouver is going to probably have to retain salary to get a deal done, and Nashville makes sense because they have a need for scorers, and they have the space. 

I assume that if something like this were to happen, we would probably be sending them a RD in return as it seems to be where we have the most depth and it would be an upgrade for Vancouver.

This does not make a lot of sense to me because of Garland's age and remaining contract. He is 27 and he is signed through 25-26 with a cap hit of $4,950,000/year. Friedman says Vancouver is probably going to have to retain at least 30% of his salary. His contract is not great for a guy who has only scored more than 20 goals once in his career. If they retained 50% of his salary, it makes a little more sense to me. It would also make his contract moveable when we have to give his roster spot to a younger player in the future.

If his cap hit were to get down to the $2,500,000 we are paying Fabbro, and we were to trade Fabbro for Garland, this would make a little sense to me. Garland would be an upgrade from Cole Smith or Kiefer Sherwood who are 27 and 28 respectively. I would like to think that Fabbro is worth more than this, but I am obviously biased. If there was a lot of demand for Fabbro, he would probably already be gone.

I would love to hear what the rest of this subreddit thinks about this.",MusicCityJayhawk,2023-10-14 21:52:52,"[('team performance', 0.08), ('coaching and management', 0.13), ('stadium amenities', 0.0), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.0), ('pricing', 0.0), ('media coverage', 0.0)]"

Parssinen, Sherwood and to an extent Smith and Evangelista seemed to float around the lines a bit more.

Fagemo still in the air, but ROR and with Nyquist-Parssinen.

Gurianov played lots of minutes with the ROR and Glass combos, which has me really baffled what was going on to put him on waivers at this point. Any thoughts on what we were hoping with this guy? I‚Äôm guessing hopes of a new spark and some scoring infusion‚Ä¶. Maybe a lack of chemistry? Style?

Walker returned to the Predators for the 2005‚Äì06 season.  However, a sports hernia suffered against the Chicago Blackhawks on October 25, 2005, as well as a wrist injury against the Dallas Stars on February 6, 2006, limited his playing time. In 33 games, Walker had five goals and 16 points, as the Predators made the playoffs for the second straight season. In five post-season games, Walker was held pointless.

303,16rtifu,"Whatever Happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators? -#22 Greg Johnson (A, C)","Greg Johnson was a professional ice hockey player in the National Hockey League with the Detroit Red Wings, Pittsburgh Penguins, Chicago Blackhawks, and Nashville Predators.

Born in Thunder Bay, Ontario in 1971, Johnson recorded 96 points in 47 games for the local Thunder Bay Flyers of the USHL in 1988‚Äì89. Johnson played four years at the University of North Dakota where he led the WCHA in assists twice and was placed on the conference First All-Star Team three straight years from 1991 to 1993. He was also placed on the NCAA West First All-American Team in 1991 and 1993.

Johnson was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers as the 33rd pick in the second round of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, but never played for the organization. On June 20, 1993, he was traded from the Flyers with future considerations to the Detroit Red Wings for Jim Cummins and a fourth round pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. Red Wings head coach and general manager Bryan Murray specifically targeted Johnson as a skilled center whom the Wings could develop.

Johnson spent parts of four seasons with the Red Wings from 1993 to 1997. On January 27, 1997, Johnson was traded by the Red Wings to the Pittsburgh Penguins for winger Tomas Sandstrom. Johnson played the rest of the 1996‚Äì97 season and part of the 1997‚Äì98 season with the Penguins before being traded to the Blackhawks for Tuomas Gronman on October 22, 1997.

Johnson was the 23rd pick of the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft by the Nashville Predators from the Chicago Blackhawks, and he would go on to spend the final seven years of his career with the team. Johnson was the second captain in Nashville Predators history from 2002 until 2006, and he served as an alternate captain from 1999 to 2002.

Johnson became part of an anomaly during the 2005‚Äì06 season when he was credited with scoring a goal before the start of a game against the Detroit Red Wings. On November 21, 2005, he scored a goal during the first period of a game that was eventually postponed after Red Wings defender Jiri Fischer suffered a cardiac arrest. The game was replayed on January 23, 2006, and, while the full game was replayed, Johnson's goal was allowed to stand, thus giving Nashville a 1‚Äì0 lead before the opening faceoff.

On August 14, 2006, Johnson signed a one-year contract to rejoin his former team, the Detroit Red Wings. In September 2006, during a routine preseason physical, an EKG test returned abnormal results. Johnson had further testing, and eventually decided to retire before training camp. In over 700 career NHL games, Johnson earned 350 points (134 goals and 216 assists). His best season was the 1998-99 season, in which he tallied 50 points (16 goals and 34 assists).  

Johnson earned a silver medal representing Canada at the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics. He also played for the Canadian National Team in the 1992‚Äì93 and 1993‚Äì94 seasons.

Johnson's brother Ryan was also a professional hockey player, playing for five teams over a fifteen-year NHL career.  On July 7, 2019, Johnson passed away at his home in Detroit, aged 48

C√¥t√© was born in LaSalle, Quebec on January 24, 1975. As a youth, he played in the 1989 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Saint-Laurent, Quebec.

Selected 37th overall by the Dallas Stars in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, C√¥t√© played only six NHL games his first two years in the NHL.  C√¥t√© signed with the Nashville Predators as an enforcer for the 1998-99 season, where he scored three points (one goal and two assists) in 91 games over two seasons.  He also picked up 313 penalty minutes during his two seasons in Nashville, which still remains as a club record for PIM.   He played six games for the Edmonton Oilers in 2000-01 but spent the rest of that season with the Hamilton Bulldogs of the AHL. He played several seasons in the Ligue Nord-Am√©ricaine de Hockey between 2001 and 2008.

In 2002, he was arrested in Malone, New York, after police found 30 pounds of marijuana in his car. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge.  On July 22, 2014, he received a 30-month prison sentence following his robbery of two banks in suburban Montreal. In 2016, he was shot by a correctional officer at Donnacona Correctional Facility in Quebec for trying to kill another inmate with his bare hands after again being found guilty in another bank robbery in Brassard, Quebec.

340,1679jvg,Whatever happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators?-#7-Cliff Ronning (A).,"Clifford John Ronning was born October 1, 1965, in Burnaby, British Columbia. Ronning played for the St. Louis Blues, Vancouver Canucks, Phoenix Coyotes, Nashville Predators, Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota Wild and New York Islanders in a career that spanned 18 years.

Ronning played minor hockey in Burnaby, where he led his midget team to a gold medal at the 1982 Air Canada Cup. Ronning was named most valuable player and led the tournament in scoring. Prior to being drafted, he played in the Western Hockey League for the New Westminster Bruins, displaying the same excellent scoring touch. In 1983‚Äì84, Ronning's draft year, he posted 136 points in 71 games, earning the Stewart ""Butch"" Paul Memorial Trophy as the league's rookie of the year.

Ronning was drafted 134th overall in the 1984 NHL Draft by the St. Louis Blues.  In 1984-85, he returned to New Westminster and accumulated an astonishing 197 points, establishing a WHL record (he was later surpassed by Rob Brown's 212-point season in 1986‚Äì87).  Accordingly, Ronning earned the WHL Most Valuable Player Award and the Bob Brownridge Memorial Trophy as the league's leading scorer. He was also named the league's most sportsmanlike player award after he only accumulated 20 penalty minutes for the season.

After Ronning's record setting season, he joined the Canadian National Team, where he played for one and a half seasons. During this stint, Ronning made his first appearance in the NHL with the Blues, playing five games in the 1986 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Ronning began the next season with the National Team again before joining the Blues for the remainder of 1986‚Äì87.

Ronning spent part of 1988‚Äì89 with the Blues' International Hockey League affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen, and played the entirety of the following season in Italy with HC Asiago. When he returned to the Blues in 1990‚Äì91, he was traded to his hometown team, the Vancouver Canucks, in a five-player deal.

Ronning quickly became a key element on the rapidly improving Canucks. In 1992‚Äì93, he posted a career-high 29 goals and 85 points. On April 15, 1993, in a game against the Los Angeles Kings, he nearly tied Brian Trottier's record for most points in a single period, notching 3 goals and 2 assists in the third. 

Ronning became a free agent after the 1995‚Äì96 season and signed with the Phoenix Coyotes for their first season post-Winnipeg. After two seasons in Phoenix, Ronning was dealt with Richard Lintner to the Nashville Predators for future considerations.

Ronning took on a leadership role with the fledgling Predators and served as an alternate captain during his time in Nashville.  During his four seasons with the Predators, Ronning led the team in scoring. He also played an important role in mentoring young players, such as David Legwand.  His best seasons were 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, where he scored 62 points each season.

At the 2001‚Äì02 trade deadline, the Predators sent Ronning to the Los Angeles Kings for their playoff push.  In the off-season, he was traded from Los Angeles to yet another recent expansion team, the Minnesota Wild. Ronning was a veteran presence, recording 48 points, as the Wild reached the Western Conference Finals before being swept by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.

In 2003‚Äì04, Ronning signed with the New York Islanders, mostly as a powerplay specialist, recording 24 points in 40 games played. As the NHL lockout suspended play, Ronning was inactive the following season. When the NHL resumed, Ronning announced his decision to retire on February 15, 2006. 

Ronning and his wife, Ivana, have four children: Taryn, Kristin and Carly and Ty. Ronning returned to live in Vancouver after his retirement. He plays with the Old-timers' Hockey Challenge and also coaches a spring hockey team, the Vancouver Selects.  In 2009, Cliff Ronning and Ron Kunisaki formed BASE Hockey Labs. Ronning heads up Base Hockey's Shooting Analysis and Custom Fitting protocol division in Burnaby, British Columbia.

Ronning's son, Ty, was drafted by the New York Rangers in the seventh round of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft.  As of 2023, Ty Ronning plays with Ingolstadt ERC in the German DEL.",99titan,2023-09-01 15:01:53,"[('team performance', 0.6), ('stadium amenities', 0.0), ('coaching and management', 0.0), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.0), ('media coverage', 0.0), ('miscellaneous', 0.07)]"

344,1640aeg,Whatever happened to the 1998-99 Nashville Predators-#21-Tom Fitzgerald (C).,"Thomas James Fitzgerald played 17 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) and American Hockey League (AHL), and he was the first captain of the Nashville Predators.  

Fitzgerald was born in Billerica, Massachusetts and played his high school hockey at Austin Preparatory School in Reading, Massachusetts.  He then went on to play college hockey for Providence College and was selected by the New York Islanders of the NHL in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft (1st round, 17th overall). He turned pro in 1988 with the Islanders' American Hockey League affiliate, Springfield Indians, and in 1990 was one of the key players who led Indians to the Calder Cup championship.

He played parts of five seasons for the Islanders and became the first player in NHL playoff history to score two shorthanded goals on the same minor penalty, against the Pittsburgh Penguins on May 2, 1993, which also equaled the NHL record for shorthanded goals by a player in one game. He was selected as one of the original Florida Panthers in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft. Although he has been cast as a defensive forward in the NHL, he had his best scoring years in Miami and was one of the leaders in Florida's 1996 Stanley Cup run. In those 1995‚Äì96 playoffs, Fitzgerald scored the decisive goal in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was a 58-foot slapshot that found its way past Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso.

He was briefly traded to the Colorado Avalanche in 1998 before signing as a free agent in the subsequent offseason with the Nashville Predators, who sought out his veteran leadership. Fitzgerald was named Nashville's first captain, serving in the capacity from 1998-2002. His best season was his first, in which he scored 32 points (13G/19A). He subsequently played for the Chicago Blackhawks and the Toronto Maple Leafs. He had signed with the Maple Leafs to a two-year contract on July 18, 2002. While with Toronto, Fitzgerald and his Maple Leafs teammate Gary Roberts both played in the 1,000th game of their careers on January 13, 2004.

In the summer of 2004, Fitzgerald signed as a free agent with the Boston Bruins. In July 2006, the Boston Bruins chose not to renew his contract. He announced his retirement after 17 NHL seasons on September 12, 2006, and he did a brief stint with NESN after his retirement. 

In July 2007, Fitzgerald left NESN when he was named Director of Player Development for the Pittsburgh Penguins. In October 2007, he was then named as an assistant coach for the United States national team for the Deutschland Cup, where he led the team to a second-place finish.   On July 3, 2009, Fitzgerald was then promoted within the Penguins organization to assistant general manager. On July 24, 2015, Fitzgerald was named assistant general manager for the New Jersey Devils. On January 12, 2020, Fitzgerald was named interim general manager of the Devils after Ray Shero was fired. On July 9, 2020, Fitzgerald was named Executive Vice President and full time General Manager of the Devils, where he serves today.

Tom and his wife Kerry have four sons: Ryan, Casey, Jack and Brendan. His son Ryan was drafted in the fourth round (120th overall) in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft by the Boston Bruins, and currently plays for the Utica Comets, the New Jersey Devils' AHL affiliate. Casey, who was drafted in the third round (86th overall) of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres, currently plays for the Florida Panthers. Both Ryan and Casey attended Boston College, skating on the same roster from 2015‚Äì2017.

Fitzgerald grew up with his cousin, fellow NHL player Keith Tkachuk He is also cousins with Tkachuk's sons Matthew of the Florida Panthers and Brady of the Ottawa Senators, as well as Kevin Hayes of the St. Louis Blues and the late Jimmy Hayes, who most recently played for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.",99titan,2023-08-28 22:30:22,"[('coaching and management', 0.49), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.35), ('miscellaneous', 0.63)]"

Throughout the summer /u/sandman730, /u/meatb4ll, and /u/spyders95 organized an in-depth Reddit hockey offseason simulation.

We all followed the real-life important hockey events in the offseason and essentially had Reddit users take over as GMs, making (for the most part)
realistic changes to the lineup through the NHL entry draft, free agency, and trades.

The end goal of the sim was to create a 23-man roster that fans of the team would judge and see how the GM did in comparison to IRL.
If you have any questions about the moves made here, please ask your GMs in the comments.
Please remember that with 31 other simulated teams, prices could vary from real life especially when trades happened earlier in the sim than in real life

Are they going to release more, or are there really that many season ticket holders?

Any suggestions for improvement are always welcome.**

One of two opening night goaltenders for the 1998-1999 Nashville Predators was Mike Dunham.  Dunham was a native of Johnson City, NY, and attended Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, a Catholic boarding school, where he was an All-New England First Team under Coach Charlie Huntington. Dunham played college hockey for the University of Maine, where he shared the goaltending duties with Garth Snow. The team won the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship in Dunham's final season, 1992‚Äì93.

Dunham was drafted in the 3rd round (53rd overall) of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. He won the Calder Cup in 1995 with the Albany River Rats. He also won the William M. Jennings Trophy with Martin Brodeur after the 1996‚Äì97 NHL season. During the 1998 expansion draft, Mike Dunham was selected by the Nashville Predators, where he played four and a half seasons.  He split the starting role with Tom√°≈° Vokoun during most of his career.

Dunham went on to play for the New York Rangers, Atlanta Thrashers, and New York Islanders after his time in Nashville. He participated in the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, helping the United States win the silver medal.  During the NHL lockout 2004-05, Dunham played with Skelleftea AIK in Sweden.  Dunham had a career record of 141‚Äì178‚Äì39‚Äì5, with 2.74 goals against average, 90.8% save percentage, and 19 shutouts.  His last season was 2006-07.

After his playing career, he went into coaching in 2007.  In September of 2007, Dunham was named goaltending coach of the New York Islanders. After 10 years, he left the Islanders in July 2017 to become the Boston Bruins' goalie development coach in August 2017, where he still serves.",99titan,2023-08-10 17:06:36,"[('miscellaneous', 0.06)]"

These seem like pretty reasonable line. I love the line debates. Thoughts?  


Novak/Parssinen seems forced, but I think the justifications on lines 2 make sense. If we needed a change of scenery, I wouldn't mind seeing Parssinen possibly on the RW with Tomasino-Glass. Hopefully this 3rd line combo can help Novaks horrible defensive play, but this could be a crucial depth line for scoring chances. This 3rd line could be where we see lots of Barrie/Josi points come in with Novaks big brain in the offensive zone.  


I like Sherwood on the herd line. I could see him/Cole Smith split time, especially on the PK, but Sherwood has the higher scoring potential and I think had a great run at the end of last year with Tomasino-Novak I believe (or was it Novak-Evangelista?) and deserves a chance. He also posted up with Tage Thompson which was awesome that he got that a scoring threat off the ice. I am a Sherwood fan.

Reason #1: the games before and after have plenty of tickets available.  Reason #2: Other sites like Stubhub have tickets available.  Last year we were able to get through the sales process only to have our credit card declined due to having out of state billing address.  We got around that by changing our address to my mama‚Äôs house in Mount Pleasant :).  I tried going through a VPN, but now Ticketmaster just thinks I‚Äôm a bot and won‚Äôt even let me on the site (I‚Äôm not mad about that actually).

381,1536f09,Coming down end of October. Hoping to catch the Preds-Leafs game,"hey preds fans. 

i'm looking to come down from Calgary for a friend's 40th the last weekend of October and (fingers crossed) get tickets to the Leafs-Preds game and maybe the Titans. Assuming there's no issue buying tickets, is there a known section for good atmosphere or is it like the Dome and it's awfully quiet except for that guy behind me who knows what everyone should be doing at all times? i'm looking forward to checking out the city but mostly looking forward to hearing the you suck and it's all your fault chants live (if you still do it)

I'm hoping to stay in the SoBro area around the Korean Vets Blvd, which looks to be recommended from the visiting nashville sub and there's plenty of options to stay. (72 degrees in Oct?? you lucky bastards!)

My question is two fold, I know that Broadway has a ton of bars but is there a bar that Preds fans go to before the game? I went to an Avs game a few years ago and their fans had one right near the arena. We have one a block away from the dome as well as inside the dome that people go to. Is tailgating a thing there for hockey? And maybe most importantly, I'm hoping to score a Smashville jersey. Any chance that they still sell them at the arena or should i start looking before I leave around here? If I am unable to source one here, is there a known store in the downtown area that might?

According to Daily Faceoff these are the projected lines for the start of the season. Obviously, things can change over the next 3 months, but for a ""rebuilding"" team this is the perfect mixture of veteran presence and young talent. This is going to be an unbelievably fun season and with the pool of prospects getting even deeper thanks to Poile's parting gifts and some quick moves by Trotz we now have another 4 players who possibly could be stepping onto the ice within 2-3 years in Wood, Molendyk, Nilsson, and Lind.

The signings came hot on the heels of a roster shake-up earlier in the week, which saw the Predators bid farewell to star forward Matt Duchene *(who has now signed with Dallas)* and sent longtime centerman Ryan Johansen packing to the Colorado Avalanche. The combination of these moves over the last few days has confused some fans about the team's direction and long-term strategy. In this short overview, I want to take a look at these moves from a few angles and try and figure out the rationale behind these decisions.

Earlier in the week, speculation ran rampant after the buyout of Duchene's contract and the departure of Ryan Johansen, with fans curious about what the freed-up cap space and empty roster spots could mean regarding the team's future. Were they clearing cap space for a blockbuster acquisition? Or perhaps a big trade move was in the works?

Just hours after free agency began, the sudden signings of three players, all aged 32 or above, caught many off guard. Only a few short days ago, General Manager Barry Trotz stated that the team wouldn't be active in the free agency market. Their focus seemed to be centered on opening up the roster for young players to receive a more significant role to make their mark on the squad. So, the acquisition of O'Reilly, Schenn, and Nyquist rightly left some fans surprised and perplexed.

The trio of new players for the Predators starkly contrasts the culture and work ethic left behind by Duchene and Johansen. They embody the qualities of seasoned veterans and natural leaders, precisely the kind of role models needed to guide and inspire the young players on the roster. Their influence could prove to be invaluable for nurturing the talents of the up-and-coming players.

Yet, opinions on the signings are divided. Some feel that bringing in these veterans will take valuable playing time away from the young players who stepped up so much last season. While others feel signing these experienced players is crucial to the development of the teams' younger talents. They believe that a healthy mix of seasoned professionals and promising prospects is the recipe for success in the long run.

Sometimes a rebuild isn't necessarily about hitting rock bottom; instead, it's about resetting or reviving the team's culture, which can be effectively achieved with the right veterans in place.

It's evident that Trotz has a clear vision for his version of the Predators, which revolves around instilling a winning locker room culture with proven winners.

For those puzzled by the signings, there's a compelling rationale behind it. The front office is looking to infuse the team with veterans who epitomize hard work and professionalism. The departures of Duchene and Johansen paved the way for this new veteran group, aimed at setting an example for the young players on how to conduct themselves on and off the ice.

While some fans might wonder if the money spent on the trio could have been allocated differently, I believe it's essential to trust in Trotz's plan and give him the benefit of the doubt until we see how his plan works out. The Predators already boast an impressive pool of prospects, and investing in experienced players is a calculated risk that could propel the team forward and foster a thriving culture for the young players to walk into.

Ultimately, whether these signings lead to a rebuilding phase or a retooling strategy remains to be fully seen. What's clear is that the Predators are charting their own path, and it's a journey that fans should be eager to witness. The new blend of veteran wisdom and youthful energy could be the key to unlocking this team's true potential.",Apprehensive_Ad4572,2023-07-02 03:44:54,"[('team performance', -0.11), ('coaching and management', 0.17), ('pricing', -0.11), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.18)]"

**Scouting Report:**

Matthew Wood was the youngest player in college hockey, and still one of its most effective ones in spite of that, finishing his freshman year with 34 points in 35 contests at the University of Connecticut. This, after a 45-goal, 85-point draft-minus-one in the BCHL with the Victoria Grizzlies.

He‚Äôs a player that‚Äôs long been on scouts‚Äô radar, and with good reason. Wood‚Äôs been putting up video game numbers at nearly every level he‚Äôs played, done so in a projectable 6-foot-3 frame, and drawn rave reviews for his character off of the ice.

Still, we greeted Wood with considerable skepticism coming into the year. That he struggled so immensely at the U18s last spring and then at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup to start this scouting season offered pause that perhaps much of his gaudy scoring could be attributed to playing in the not-so-competitive Coastal Conference in a Junior A league (albeit one of the stronger ones).

Much of this skepticism appeared to be confirmed by Wood‚Äôs early work at college. Sure, the points came easy. The Huskies funneled their power play through his cannon of a shot, and it worked. Closer scrutiny revealed a mostly unidimensional player with significant mechanical hurdles and inflated point totals.

‚Äú*Wood has mostly played like a blunt object at college, but it hasn‚Äôt kept him from stringing together some highly productive outings with UConn in the early goings,‚Äù* EP Rinkside Editor-in-Chief and resident college hockey scout J.D. Burke wrote in one of his October game reports. *‚ÄúMany of the same red flags that tempered my enthusiasm at the Hlinka Gretzky remain. Wood is still playing an incredibly simple north-south game and not showing much explosiveness or dynamism in the process.*‚Äù

Then, something changed. Wood‚Äôs game took a significant step forward in time for the new year, showing a more projectable, compelling complement of skills that just might allow him to generate offence at the next level in a sustainable fashion.

You start with the handling. Where Wood used to exclusively take on defenders from a glide with the puck exposed well in front of him and his feet and hands locked in unison, he was now using hip pocket handling, feints, weight shifts, and even give-and-goes to get around defenders. You know, the sort of thing that will work against NHL defencemen.

Next up, growth as a distributor. Simple things like scanning away from the puck and maintaining a detailed mental map of the ice allowed him to connect with pacey one- and two-touch passing plays. You‚Äôre not looking at the second coming of Joe Thornton here, but Wood became a strong enough distributor that teams now have to respect the threat of his pass. This, of course, will open up opportunities as a shooter.

Still, the skating is grim. That much hasn‚Äôt changed. It was every bit as sluggish at the U18s to close out the year as it was at Hlinka Gretzky that started it. And it affects every part of his game. Any hope of a top-six projection rests on at least a full-grade improvement in this regard over the next two or three seasons.

When you watch someone take as many significant steps forward in their development over the course of their draft year as Wood did at UConn this season, though, it‚Äôs easy enough to imagine a scenario where that happens. He‚Äôd hardly be the first player in a 6-foot-3 frame to need a little extra time to get up to speed.

If that happens, Wood has the capacity to be a top-six forward with size, a booming shot that can credibly threaten from range, handling skill, and some cunning as a distributor. No, he‚Äôs probably not the next Tage Thompson, no matter how many outlets will try to make that comparison, but he can be a solid contributor in his own right.

**Industry Chatter:**

‚Äú*Biggish centre that I think can grow a bit. Get the feet moving. I like that he went to UConn, I like seeing more Canadians going that route, using American colleges like Fantilli and Wood did to get roles at 18 they maybe wouldn‚Äôt otherwise. I also like how strong he is.*‚Äù - Western Conference scout, May 2023

‚Äú*He‚Äôs a little bit of an enigma there. On the power play, he‚Äôs great. When his top speed is going, he‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs just that his skating is a big concern for where the NHL is going right now. He‚Äôs got a great stick, soft hands, but you never see him as the F1 and you only really see him score on the power play. His first three steps really have to improve. He does some good things, it‚Äôs just that there are some holes in his game.*‚Äù ‚Äì Western Conference scout, May 2023

‚Äú*I‚Äôve been to games where Wood has outplayed Cutter Gauthier. The production is tremendous for his age. Elite shooter. One of the best shots in the draft. Awesome offensive hockey sense. Gets open in scoring areas. Ability to make plays with his stick. Some question his compete. I have no issue with it. The skating is his major detriment. If he makes the NHL he will be one of the worst skaters. At the same time at the Hlinka, last year internationally, BCHL. He‚Äôs produced beyond his age level. Release, size. Hands, hockey sense is top end. Could be a Mark Stone type.*‚Äù ‚Äì NHL scout, April 2023

‚Äú*I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm an offensive threat. I can score from anywhere and make plays. But I don‚Äôt take the defensive side of the game lightly at all.*‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew Wood, April 2023

‚Äú*I wear 71 because of Yevgeni Malkin. He has always been my favourite player. Obviously, Tage Thompson went to UConn as well. I try to look at his game and model my game after him too. Two great players and I really look up to those guys for sure.*‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew Wood, April 2023

‚Äú*With Matthew Wood, he‚Äôs a big, tall guy with some speed, great hands, and he complemented the other guys, but he can make some plays as well that kind of make you go ‚Äòwow.‚Äô*‚Äù ‚Äì Canada U18 head coach Jeff Truitt, April 2023

‚Äú*I thought college would help me work on things like playing with pace stuff like that. It‚Äôs a fast game with strong guys and I thought that would get me ready for the next level and push me to where I want to be.*‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew Wood, December 2022

‚Äú*I love making plays. Finding open guys. Drawing guys to me. It‚Äôs one of my favorite parts of the game.*‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew Wood, December 2022

**15. Nashville** **Predators**: **Matthew Wood**, RW, UCONN (H-EAST)

February 6, 2005 | 6‚Ä≤ 4‚Ä≥ | 197 pounds

Tier: Bubble top and middle of the lineup player

**Player comparable:** Drake Batherson

**Background:** Wood had a highly productive 17-year-old freshman season at UConn scoring a point per game. As a 16-year-old he led the BCHL in goals and points. At both this past summer‚Äôs Hlinka Gretzky and the 2022 U18 worlds, Wood played a limited even-strength/heavy power-play role for Team Canada but at the 2023 U18 worlds he was a top forward at the tournament.

**Analysis:** Wood is a very gifted offensive player. He has excellent one-on-one skills and offensive IQ. He has the ability to hold onto pucks for an extra second and knows how to beat defenders with skill. He also has an excellent wrist shot and one-timer, making him a major asset on the power play. Wood is a big winger as well, so the size/skill combo has a lot of upside. However, his skating is an issue as he lacks the ability to separate, and the pace of the NHL will challenge him. I wouldn‚Äôt call him an overly physical or high compete type, and I‚Äôve seen him take nights off, but Wood is a big body who can use his frame to win battles and gets to the inside parts of the offensive zone well enough. I think he‚Äôll be a quality top six winger who will be a big part of an NHL power play, but he may frustrate his coaches at times.

**Thoughts on the pick:** Wood is a very talented offensive player. It‚Äôs not easy to find first-year draft eligibles who led their NCAA team in scoring, never mind at 6-foot-4. The Predators have a lot of needs for their rebuild, but they need high-end talent most of all, and Wood provides that. He needs to round out his game and with his OK footspeed he may need two to four years before he‚Äôs ready for the NHL.",Unknown,2023-06-30 21:15:28,"[('team performance', 0.23), ('coaching and management', 0.09)]"

437,14n7ff3,Breaking Down the Nashville Predators' Decision to Buy Out Matt Duchene: A Bold Move with a Hidden Agenda?,"In a surprising move, the Nashville Predators have decided to buy out the remaining contract of star forward Matt Duchene.  

Duchene, who has been a pivotal contributor to the Predators' in recent seasons, certainly doesn't deserve to be written off as a failure. Throughout his time in Nashville he has been a solid contributor and has had some fantastic years with the club, including last season, when he was the team's leading scoring forward and a critical piece to their success when he was healthy. 

After the news of the buyout broke, speculation immediately began to swirl, with fans and pundits alike wondering whether this move was merely a precursor to a more significant acquisition via free agency or trade. Could the Predators be eyeing a high-profile forward to bolster their lineup? This move might make more sense if it was to free up some cap space if a substantial addition was on the horizon. Barry Trotz has already proven to be an aggressive general manager, and it wouldn't be surprising to see him make a splash here in the next few days.

However, buying out Duchene's contract raises questions about the team's long-term plans. With significant dead cap space resulting from this move, it's worth wondering if the Predators are set on a complete rebuild of the team. If trading superstar goaltender Juuse Saros is on the table, that might signal a shift toward a complete tank. But if general manager Barry Trotz's recent statements are to be believed, he insists that Saros **is not** being actively shopped. This leaves fans in a perplexing position. What was this buyout's purpose if a Saros trade isnt on the horizon?

Another point of contention is the impact of this move on the team's competitiveness. Despite the buyout, the Predators are not yet positioning themselves as a full-blown tanking team. With a world-class goaltender like Saros, who is a Vezina Trophy contender every season he plays, they are still expected to compete and remain in the playoff picture. The notion of tanking with Saros between the pipes seems implausible, as he has single-handedly prevented the Predators from missing the playoffs multiple times in his career. If the vision is indeed to tank, then a Saros trade would make sense and align with that strategy. However, if Saros remains with the team, this buyout raises more questions than answers.

The Predators find themselves at a crossroads. This move is undeniably perplexing, considering Duchene's contributions and the long-lasting impact of the dead cap space. There are only two viable paths forward for the organization. Either they fully embrace a rebuild, trading Saros and committing to the tank, or they aggressively pursue trades and offer sheets for restricted free agents and take risks to reshape their roster into a competitive force once again. 

While some may argue that this buyout was a misstep, others hope the Predators have a master plan in motion. Fans and pundits anxiously await further developments and announcements from the Nashville front office.

When it comes to evaluating the Nashville Predators' draft picks, one cannot easily pinpoint any players who could be deemed as outright ""steals"" based on their draft positions. While Matthew Wood, selected 15th overall, could be considered a reasonable choice given his average consensus ranking of 13, it doesn't necessarily scream out as an impressive or noteworthy selection in terms of value. Personally, I had him slotted in at the 20th spot on my big board, which makes it somewhat of a slight reach in my estimation.

Now, let's delve into the rankings for the Predators' second pick, Tanner Molendyk, taken at the 24th spot overall. It's worth mentioning that my big board had him ranked 64th, while the consensus ranking had him pegged as the 40th-best prospect. Once again, this selection leans more towards the reach category rather than an exceptional value pick.

Examining the first two choices made by the Predators, it becomes evident that they had their sights set on these players but failed to acquire great value in the process. However, two names do stand out when discussing value acquisitions. First up is Jesse Kiiskinen, the 68th overall pick, who remarkably secured the 18th spot on my big board. The average consensus rank positioned him as the 67th-best prospect in the entire draft.  Another player who surprisingly slipped down the draft order was Aiden Fink, nabbed by the Predators at the 218th spot in the seventh round. From my evaluation, Fink ranked as the 48th best prospect, while the average consensus placed him at 100th. This late-round steal truly caught my attention, as I anticipated his name being called much earlier.

All in all, the Predators executed a solid draft strategy, focusing on players that catered to their specific needs rather than simply selecting the best available prospect. While they may not have secured any groundbreaking steals, the aforementioned Kiiskinen and Fink certainly represent valuable additions to the organization.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Preds Prospect Overviews:**

&#x200B;

**Matthew Wood:** Wood is a standout 18-year-old forward from the NCAA's Huskies and has emerged as one of the most promising prospects in college hockey. His improved wrist shot, characterized by a well-maintained distance between his feet and hands, has become a potent weapon, allowing him to shoot accurately from various positions and even in motion. Wood's ability to seamlessly chain together plays, whether it's making decisive passes under pressure or executing toe-drags to create shooting opportunities, showcases his exceptional offensive instincts. Standing at an imposing 6-foot-4 and weighing 197 pounds, Wood's lethal shot, averaging approximately three per game, has caught the attention of many scouts, who laud him as a big power forward with an amazing ability to find the back of the net. With continued development, Wood's raw talent and scoring prowess could propel him to great heights at the NHL level.

&#x200B;

**Tanner Molendyk:** A skillful and smooth-skating blueliner, he stands out with his exceptional agility, mobility, and speed. His ability to elude opponents in all areas of the ice and create scoring chances is a testament to his confidence and patience in decision-making. Despite his smaller stature, Molendyk plays bigger than his size, delivering impactful open-ice hits. His offensive instincts are often overlooked, as his point total doesn't fully reflect his threat to generate offensive chances. Defensively, he excels and is relied upon as a valuable contributor on the penalty kill. In the 2023 Draft class, Molendyk's standout feature is his unmatched skating ability, characterized by his explosive speed, flawless transitions, and precise stick work. With his accurate shot and strong transition game, he proves himself to be a capable two-way defender.

&#x200B;

**Felix Nilsson:** Nilsson is a well-rounded center with a high hockey IQ and excellent playmaking abilities. His strong vision and mental awareness enable him to create scoring opportunities for his teammates through precise passing and quick decision-making. While not necessarily elite in any specific aspect, Nilsson's above-average skills in all areas of the game make him a reliable player who excels both offensively and defensively. With his continued development, Nilsson has the potential to become a valuable third-line center in the NHL, capable of contributing to both even-strength play and power play.

&#x200B;

**Kalan Lind:** A fearless and physical player whose skills are tied together by his unending intensity. With a knack for making big hits and winning body positioning, Lind also demonstrates subtle brilliance in his game. He excels at tying up opponents around his own net, setting picks, and creating seamless breakouts. Additionally, his simple yet effective style stands out as he uses his speed to drive straight to the net, forcing the opposition to back up and creating space for himself. Lind's ability to find loose pucks and finish scoring opportunities, particularly when crashing the crease, showcases his sixth sense on the ice. His aggressive play, relentless forechecking, and ability to get under opponents' skin make him a challenging player to face. Lind's all-around game is evident as he competes in all areas of the ice, consistently emptying the tank between whistles. With continued development, he is poised to become a bottom-six forward who excels on the penalty kill while also providing decent offensive production. As Lind gains more weight, his physicality will become an even greater asset in the NHL.

&#x200B;

**Jesse Kiiskinen:** Kiiskinen is an exceptionally driven player who never quits on a play. His relentless work ethic shines through in his tenacious forechecking, catching defenders off-guard, and making key defensive contributions. Kiiskinen's offensive skills are particularly impressive, as he possesses a powerful shot and the ability to both score goals and make precise passes. With further development, his skating and strength will only improve, making him an even greater threat on the ice. Kiiskinen's leadership qualities are evident in his ""lead by example"" style of play, and while his potential is initially projected as a third-line winger, his young age and room for growth suggest the possibility of reaching second-line status with proper development.

&#x200B;

**Dylan MacKinnon:** MacKinnon is a reliable and adaptable defenseman who excels in his defensive responsibilities. His solid skating stance and active stick allow him to effectively defend against opposing rushes, while his strong presence in the neutral zone ensures he maintains excellent gap control. MacKinnon's physicality and net-front coverage skills make him a difficult player to go up against, and as his offensive abilities continue to develop, he has the potential to become a valuable second-pairing shutdown defenseman in the NHL. Whether protecting a lead or making a game-changing defensive play, MacKinnon is a player who consistently rises to the occasion.

&#x200B;

**Aiden Fink:** The standout player in Canada's Junior A circuit this season, possesses an impressive arsenal of skills that make him a formidable force on the ice. With his exceptional speed, energy, and anticipation, Fink sets the tempo of play and consistently executes the best offensive plays. His NHL-caliber shot, combined with his creative playmaking ability, forces defenders to make difficult choices. Fink's ability to maneuver with the puck at high speeds, as well as his contributions to the success of the Brooks Bandits, demonstrate his potential to excel at higher levels. While he may be smaller in stature, Fink's exceptional puck skills, craftiness, and timing in the offensive zone indicate that he has the potential to become a middle-six winger in the NHL. With further development and increased physicality, Fink's speed and shot alone make him a strong candidate for an NHL bottom-six role.

464,14kfti1,Predators 2023 NHL Draft - Potential Realistic Targets and Analysis,"With the 2023 draft less than 48 hours away, it is time to look towards some of the players that the Preds may select with the #15 & #24 picks (Assuming the picks are kept).

As many of you may know through your involvement in this sub, following prospects in hockey is a personal interest of mine. I am by no means an expert, but I have spent significant time watching many of the top players in this class, and wanted to share some of my outlooks with you all!

&#x200B;

Pick #15

***Oliver Moore (C) - USNTDP (USHL)***

**Personal Rank #8**

**Consensus Rank #10-20**

Analysis - Moore is arguably the top skater in the class, with fluid skating mechanics that rival the best I have ever covered for a prospect. Playing on his own line on the USNTDP team, Moore still dominated without the help of Smith, Leonard or Perrault. His speed stands out, but his hands are able to match his quick movement, with IQ that utilizes both to the highest potential. A true dual-threat to pass and shoot, Moore has the raw skill that I believe will be able to translate at the NHL level.

**Projection - First Line All-Star Caliber Winger**

&#x200B;

***Dmitri Simashev (D) - Lokomotiv (KHL)***

**Personal Rank #9**

**Consensus Rank #10-30**

Analysis - My personal favourite and the one who I believe is the most underrated in the class, Simashev oozes upside that gets me extremely excited. At 6'4"", you may think he lacks mobility, but that's actually his strongest trait! The kid can flat-out skate, exiting the zone all by himself, even in the second best league in the world. His offensive upside is elite, but his defensive game makes for a safe floor as an overall player. Due to his high-end skating, Simashev is able to shutdown opposing players on rushes with both his stick and his body, often laying punishing hits. If everything breaks right, I see him turning into a Hedman-esque player.

**Projection - #2 All-Star D-man with #1 Upside**

&#x200B;

***Axel-Sandin Pellika (D) - Skelleftea (SHL)***

**Personal Rank #12**

**Consensus Rank #10-20**

Analysis - Poise, poise, poise. That's the easiest way to describe him. I have never covered a defenseman as calm as Pellika. Another fantastic skater, Pellika is able to maneuver his way around under pressure, as if he's not under pressure at all. It's difficult to find prospects without a glaring weakness, but Pellika breaks that theory. Safe overall floor, with upside to be one of the highest point producers from the back-end in the future. Don't want to get you all too excited, but I truly see shades of Josi in his skating.

**Projection - #2 D-man**

&#x200B;

Pick #24

***Mikhail Gulyayev (D) - Omsk Avangard (KHL)***

**Personal Rank #13**

**Consensus Rank #15-30**

Analysis - Another one of my favourite prospects in this class, Gulyayev is an absolute speedster that often acts as a one-man defensive zone exit. He's truly mesmerizing to watch, as he eases his way past everyone on the ice consistently. His defensive ability is not a liability due to his elite skating, but his size may give him issues in corners with the top NHL puck-protectors. I believe the skating is worth taking a shot on the upside alone. He's an ideal PP QB with his elite-level zone entries.

**Projection - #2-3 D-man**

&#x200B;

***Andrew Cristall (LW) - Kelowna (WHL)***

**Personal Rank #9**

**Consensus Rank #10-30**

Analysis - Contrary to what I typically look for in a prospect (Skating), Cristall is actually very underwhelming in this department, which is a reason why I think he could slip to this pick on draft day. Although his skating mechanics need major work, his other attributes such as his ridiculous hands and vision more than make up for it and give him a monstrous ceiling if he can become even an average NHL skater. He's an offensive dynamo, with creativity that rivals the top in this class.

**Projection - Second Liner with First Liner upside if skating improves**

473,14ibho8,Thoughts and breakdown after the Trade,"Obviously, this trade sheds light once again on the Predators‚Äô intent to revamp this roster. As the dust settles on this trade, I want to delve into the intricacies and potential ramifications for the Predators.

Ryan Johansen, known for his mercurial performances and playmaking abilities, had been a cornerstone of the Predators‚Äô forward line for nearly a decade. However, his inconsistency and recent injury proneness rendered him a questionable investment against his hefty $8 million per year contract. By trading Johansen away, the Predators have freed up cap space and relieved themselves of a player who failed to live up to the expectations set by his substantial salary.  
When you look at the acquisition (if they even choose to sign him) of Alex Galchenyuk in this trade, the Predators received a former third-overall pick who has experienced both success and setbacks during his NHL career. While Galchenyuk spent the previous season in the AHL, his past achievements as a consistent near 20-goal scorer stand out. Although his role on the Predators‚Äô roster remains uncertain, his potential utility makes him an intriguing addition if kept on. The Predators may have seen something in Galchenyuk that could contribute to their plans, or they might let him walk in free agency. 

  
With Johansen‚Äôs departure from the team, the Predators are poised to embrace the emergence of young talent throughout the entire roster. The likely candidate to fill the Center role is the promising Cody Glass, who showcased his improvement and skills during the previous season. Glass, at the age of 24, presents a perfect bridge piece for the team‚Äôs ongoing rebuild, with the potential to provide stability and contribute to the Predators‚Äô offensive prowess for the foreseeable future.  
This trade may signify the Predators‚Äô desire to make a substantial splash in the trade market this offseason. General Manager Barry Trotz has already voiced his disinterest in this season‚Äôs free agency options, hinting at the team‚Äôs intention to utilize the newly available resources. With the freed-up cap space and an arsenal of draft picks acquired through last season‚Äôs trades, the Predators are now in an ideal position to pursue top-tier available players. Alex DeBrincat, a name linked to the Predators in recent weeks, could fit the bill, bringing much-needed offensive talent and scoring ability to the team.  
Regardless of the team‚Äôs motivations behind this trade, Ryan Johansen‚Äôs departure will undoubtedly leave a void in Nashville. The fans and his teammates will miss his contributions on and off the ice. However, this trade represents a calculated move by the Predators to shed cap space, rejuvenate their roster, and position themselves for future success. As the NHL offseason unfolds, the Predators possess the financial flexibility and assets to make significant moves in the trade market, ensuring an intriguing and transformative period for the franchise.

&#x200B;

**Just curious what others think about this. Do you think this means the Preds are going after a big name in the trade market, and if so, who should they go after? Im going to miss Joey, but I'm hoping that 4 million goes to signing or trading for someone who can be dynamic on offense.**

[https://www.espn.co.uk/nhl/recap/\_/gameId/310123006](https://www.espn.co.uk/nhl/recap/_/gameId/310123006)

I was searching on youtube and [nhl.com](https://nhl.com) but I can't find the Game in 6 or video recap of this game anywhere.  


So I like making posts about Cody Franson because I always loved watching him play, and I always thought he was a legitimately good defenseman who is severely underappreciated. I think he is a player who deserves another shot in the NHL to see what he is capable of on a good team, especially because he is the kind of guy who absolutely kills it come playoff time. In that game that I posted, Franson gets two assists + a shootout goal, and I think it's his only attempt in the NHL (he scored in his AHL attempt too). So finding the game video to this is very valuable to me.

Thank you Nashville bros!

I was blown away by how good the Rochester broadcast team sounded...and they're in the AHL. It got me thinking about how the Preds TV broadcasts are subpar. I mean, there's nothing wrong with them...but they're just eh. Coincidentally, The Athletic posted an article this week ranking the NHL broadcast teams that pretty much says the same thing. 

So what would you do to fix it? I'd start by moving Willy to the desk. I like him, but he's not a natural PBP guy. I mean he got the radio PBP job because someone else quit mid-season, remember that? Then he moved to TV when Pete wanted to do radio. Nothing against him, but I think he'd be better hosting at the desk. 

I think Max Herz would be a good replacement on PBP. He's young, but so what? The Kings hired a 20-something for their TV PBP and it worked out fine. He sounds good and he's got passion in his voice.

Trotz and Brunette talked about more speed and scoring and playing more modern hockey. They openly said they wanted to make it more exciting and fun for fans.

Also, there is no doubt Trotz is running the show and he is going to do exactly what he thinks is best for the team. Some people around the league might have been pissed about not firing Hynes earlier. It doesn‚Äôt look like he is too concerned with outside opinions. It was pretty obvious Trotz is going to put the organization over any individual.

I think the process was a home run for Trotz. From LeBrun‚Äôs article, it sounds like he interviewed six coaches. He took all his time and didn‚Äôt waiver from it. It doesn‚Äôt look like he is going to half-ass his job and he is going to be very aggressive.

Brunette is of course something of an unknown but for sure he seems like Trotz‚Äôs guy. This is something of a change in that Poile hired his coach and then supported him.

546,13v0wis,Should we trade up for Matvei Michkov?,"Matvei Michkov is an ELITE RW in the coming draft. Many scouts are saying that Michkov is the closest prospect to Bedard this year in terms of pure talent. Kind of like how Eichel was second to McDavid, even though they are both Centers. Any other year Eichel probably would have been the first overall pick. Some draft experts are saying that about Michkov, even though Michkov is a RW and not a Center. 

For those of you who don't know, he has signed a contract to play in the KHL through the 24-25 season. Everyone thinks that he will come to the NHL at that time, but there is a possiblity that he could stay in the KHL after that. Some players have chosen to stay in the KHL instead of playing in the NHL in the past, but none of the prospects at this high a level have ever chosen to stay in the KHL. The war in Ukraine adds a little uncertainty as well, but it is unlikely that he would be affected by it. Additionally, many GMs don't have the job stability to wait 2+ years for a Top 10 prospect.

All of the NHL draft pundits seem mixed on where he might get drafted. Detroit and Arizona both make sense as landing spots for him. Detroit, because Detroit's GM is Steve Yzerman (who is russian), or Arizona because they need desprately need something to excite their fan base.  St. Louis and Washington could also make sense, to replace Terasenko and Ovechkin respectively.

If Michkov falls to 15, he would be a steal. Poile loves to draft players who fall to him (i.e. Kemell, Tomasino, Tolvanen), and you have to think that Trotz will want a player like this after coaching Ovechkin. But it is very unlikely that he falls out of the top 10.

Finally, with the draft being in Nashville, this would be the one move that would compete with the attention of Chicago getting Bedard.

In the realm of the NHL, few names carry as much weight and respect as Patrick Roy. With a storied playing career and a wealth of coaching accolades, Roy embodies the essence of a true leader behind the bench. Fondly referred to as ""Saint Patrick,"" his remarkable achievements and unique coaching style make him an ideal fit for the Nashville Predators.  
Roy's playing days were split between two renowned franchises: the Montreal Canadiens and the Colorado Avalanche. Over his illustrious 19-year career, he captured the hearts of fans and the attention of the hockey world. The iconic goaltender secured an impressive four Stanley Cups, with two triumphs for each team he represented.  
Acknowledged as the greatest goaltender in NHL history, Roy's legacy extends beyond his remarkable on-ice performances. The influential netminder was deservedly inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 13, 2006, forever solidifying his place among the sport's elite.  
However, it is Roy's coaching prowess that truly sets him apart. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, he steered the Colorado Avalanche to a staggering 112-point season, capturing the Central Division title. The team's remarkable accomplishments included tying a franchise record with 52 wins, boasting the league's best road record, and an impressive undefeated streak when leading after two periods. Roy was bestowed with the Jack Adams Award for his invaluable contributions, recognized as the NHL's top coach. This accolade marked his ability to inspire greatness in his players and lead them to unprecedented success.  
Beyond his NHL achievements, Roy's coaching prowess extends to his tenure in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). For an impressive 13 years, from 2005 to 2013 and then again from 2018 to 2023, he commanded the helm of the Quebec Remparts.  
Roy's teams made the playoffs every season he coached, highlighting his consistency and ability to develop winning cultures. Additionally, he steered his squad to first-place finishes in the division for an impressive six out of the 13 seasons‚Äîan undeniable testament to his coaching acumen and ability to foster a winning environment.

Known for his unwavering support and defense of his players, he strikes a delicate balance between advocating for his team while also holding them accountable. Although occasionally drawing attention, his outspokenness and aggression showcase his commitment to honesty and integrity, traits that have earned him respect throughout the league.  
As Nathan MacKinnon, one of Roy's former players, revealed, ""I didn't realize how smart he'd be. He understands the game so well‚Ä¶ It's only my second season, but I'm sure he's one of the most progressive coaches in the league."" MacKinnon's words illuminate Roy's ability to think strategically and adapt to the evolving nature of the sport. This progressive mindset, coupled with his genuine passion and competitive drive, make him an ideal mentor for the Nashville Predators' young squad.  
In a league where communication and connection with players are paramount, Roy's relatability shines through. He possesses the unique ability to make his players feel appreciated, heard, and valued, fostering a positive and supportive environment. This aspect becomes even more crucial when working with a young team like the Predators, where guidance and mentorship are vital for player development.  
Patrick Roy's illustrious playing career, combined with his remarkable coaching accomplishments, make him an ideal fit for the Nashville Predators. His unique coaching style, ability to inspire greatness, and dedication to player development set him apart as a top-tier coach in the NHL. With his expertise, experience, and winning mindset he brings, Roy would undoubtedly lead the Predators to new levels of success and establish a culture of excellence within the organization.

Over the years, he has managed to have success with several teams, including the Montreal Canadiens, Vancouver Canucks, New York Rangers, and Philadelphia Flyers. In 2007, he clinched the prestigious Jack Adams Award, which recognizes the NHL's top coach of the year. During his time in Vancouver, he became the Canucks all-time winningest coach with 313 wins, winning back-to-back Presidents' Trophies and appearing in one Stanley Cup Final.

&#x200B;

* Made Playoffs in 52.6% of years coached

&#x200B;

* Coached 100-point teams 26.3% of the time

&#x200B;

* Jack Adams Award Winner (2008-9)

Claude Julien's impressive coaching career speaks volumes, highlighted by his stellar points percentage of 58.7% and a Stanley Cup championship win with the Boston Bruins in 2011. Throughout his illustrious career, he has led his teams to the playoffs an impressive ten times, enjoying deep runs in several appearances. One of Julien's notable strengths is his ability to create a solid defensive foundation through sound structures and effective systems. He strongly emphasizes defense, but not at the expense of offense, as evidenced by his Bruins team being one of the better possession teams in the NHL after the 2012 lockout. With a talented forward corps and an elite goaltender anchoring the defense, Julien's strategic approach could be an ideal fit for the Nashville Predators. With his guidance, the Predators' young core could develop into a formidable team capable of challenging for the Stanley Cup in the coming years.

Dan Bylsma could be the right coach to lead the Nashville Predators to glory. His impressive track record speaks volumes; with a points percentage of 61.5% and a playoff win-loss percentage of 55.1%, Bylsma has the experience and winning mentality the Predators need. He led the Penguins to the Stanley Cup championship in 2009 and reached the playoffs in 75% of the years he coached while boasting a 50% success rate with 100-point teams. Bylsma's coaching philosophy is rooted in a north-south style of play, with an emphasis on quick, long stretch passes that keep opponents off balance. His system can be complex, but it has proven to be effective, as evidenced by his Jack Adams Award for the league's most outstanding coach in 2010-2011. Bylsma's offbeat approach to motivating his players, such as rewarding the last player to score in a shootout practice with the responsibility of growing a mustache, could be what the Predators need to lighten the mood in the locker room. All things considered, Dan Bylsma's winning record and innovative coaching style make him a prime candidate for the Nashville Predators' head coaching position.

Boudreau's coaching style centers around a fast-paced, ""run and gun"" approach to offense that has yielded success for players such as Alexander Ovechkin and Nicklas B√§ckstr√∂m during his time with the Capitals. Additionally, Boudreau has a track record of developing players and helping them achieve career years, such as Ryan Getzlaf, Nick Bonino, and Mikael Granlund.

&#x200B;

**Young Coaches:**

If the Nashville Predators are looking for a fresh and promising option for their head coach, grooming a talented assistant coach could be a great avenue to explore. A young and ambitious coach who has been affiliated with successful NHL teams and has firsthand experience with winning cultures, strategies, and teams could be the perfect candidate for the job.

With the recent appointment of General Manager Barry Trotz, he could potentially take the reins and mentor this budding coach throughout the entirety of the rebuild process. This approach would allow for a smooth transition and continuity in the team's development.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that all the coaches listed possess substantial NHL experience, including time spent as players. This experience could prove valuable as they strive to lead the Nashville Predators toward a bright and successful future.

576,13jrfns,Ads games are so much fun,"First of all, a big thank you to every one who kindly replied to my last post and provided tips on parking and food! All are very helpful, definitely made my trip easy.

I was at both Game 1 and Game 2 last weekend. First time sitting behind the penalty box, had a blast! There was a 3-on-5 in Game 1, and Texas's Barber was in the box THREE times in Game 2.

Both games were exciting, you guys saw them. Beyond the games, I really enjoyed everything, the fans were loud, concession was decent, lots of food and drink choices, the fan games/videos during the intermission/breaks were very entertaining. THEY ALSO HAD A BLIMP! Got two free bells at the entrance, one for each game, and bought a T-shirt, a magnet and a Roscoe pin.

581,13iggyj,Short Snapshots: Will Joakim Kemell have a spot on the Nashville Predators Roster next Season?," Joakim Kemell, the young 19-year-old Finnish winger, has been making waves in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Milwaukee Admirals this season. With a keen eye for space and a deadly shot, Kemell has been one of the AHL's most exciting young players to end the regular season, ranking ninth in the league in win-share percentage for players 21 years old or younger (as of April 23rd, 2023). But with the NHL offseason looming, some Preds fans are asking: will Kemell make the jump to the Predators roster this coming season, or will he continue his development in the AHL? Let's dive into this question a bit. There is no denying that Kemell's skill set is impressive. He has a knack for finding open space and positioning himself for scoring opportunities, and his shooting ability is top-notch. He's not afraid to get creative with the puck and take on defenders, making him an entertaining player to watch. Despite being 5'11"", Kemell plays with a lot of jump, physicality, and more grit than most people give him credit for. Even though he's been having impressive AHL performances, there are still concerns about Kemell's readiness for the NHL. The Nashville Predators have a history of being patient with young prospects in the organization, giving them time to develop in the AHL for long periods of time. Kemell is still adjusting to North American ice after playing in Finland his entire career, and depending on how he performs in the Calder playoffs this year and the regular season next year, he may need another season in the AHL before jumping to the NHL to fully adjust and refine his skills on an American rink.

 The Predators will have a lot of players vying for a spot on the wing next season. Veterans like Mark Jankowski, Michael McCarron, Cole Smith, and Keifer Sherwood will all be fighting for a spot, and that‚Äôs not even including young players such as Egor Afanasyev, Luke Evangelista, and Phil Tomasino. All these players will be in the mix for the last few wing spots on the roster, and a few very talented players arent going to make the cut. Given Nashville‚Äôs tendency to let young players develop in the AHL, it‚Äôs unlikely that Kemell will get the nod over these more experienced players. That being said, Kemell‚Äôs performance in the AHL this season has been encouraging, and he has proved that he could adapt to North American ice and excel in a smaller rink. His ability to score goals and make plays will undoubtedly catch the attention of Nashville‚Äôs coaching staff in training camp and preseason. While it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll make the roster next season, the future looks bright for this young Finnish star.¬†¬†

No other arena is so focused, so passionate. I swear when I go to Preds games it feels like the whole arena is calling out in a single voice to the opposing team‚Äôs goalie, answering back the PA announcer, and just cheering on the greatest team in hockey. Even for meaningless, out of conference games in the middle of the season, the Bridgestone crowd is just unreal.

Svechkov was drafted as a good two-way Center. Initially, he was property of KHL powerhouse SKA St. Petersburg but was part of a crazy 9-for-1 trade with Spartak last year. Most of those nine players were players who either weren‚Äôt expected to stick around or played somewhere else. Getting traded could lead one to believe he wanted to come to the NHL sooner than later.

SKA also had Askarov before and barely played him in any league when he wouldn‚Äôt extend that last year.

This season, Svechkov split time in the three Russian leagues again. He played the most as a fourth-liner with Spartak and scored a few goals as a 19-year old. He was also very good in the MHL (Russian juniors) and VHL (the Russian version of the AHL) playoffs. It appears he found another level to his game. His offense keeps getting better.

It would not be the worst thing for him to play a couple more years in the KHL but I expect him to come over for next year.",evanwilliams212,2023-05-02 01:29:59,"[('team performance', 0.15), ('coaching and management', 0.3), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.05), ('pricing', 0.1), ('media coverage', 0.25)]"

639,12n7ge6,End of the Poile era,"Last night was a much better time than I thought it would be, and I say this as a guy who‚Äôs married to an Av‚Äôs fan. Not our best season, arguably not even a very good one, but damn I had fun regardless, and the future‚Äôs bright y‚Äôall. 

My only gripe about last night (feel free to throw cold water on me if this is a dumb take): I wish the ovation for Poile had been more enthusiastic. It was tepid and that made for an awkward moment in the arena. 

Yes, I understand how bad we‚Äôve been boned lately with bad trades, big contracts that don‚Äôt yield results, and the entire coaching situation. I‚Äôm not thrilled about any of that. But! 

Poile was the architect of some incredible lineups over the years, and we were so damn close. The refs/Joey‚Äôs injury in ‚Äò17. Those final seconds of Game 5 vs Chicago in ‚Äò10. Even the Sharks series in ‚Äò07 when they were somehow allowed to push us around with no whistles. (We don‚Äôt talk about 2012 vs Arizona.) 

Most importantly, he was instrumental in *keeping the team in Nashville* during the nightmare fire-sale days. 

Maybe I‚Äôm seeing the world through a rose-colored visor, but I appreciate you, David. Perhaps this is all due to ticket prices (the balance of hard core fans vs. tourists and wealthy-but-unenthusiastic people in the stands has changed), but I thought you deserved better.",Clovis_Winslow,2023-04-15 15:27:26,"[('team performance', 0.45), ('coaching and management', 0.1)]"

641,12mon32,I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things.,"Gosh, y‚Äôall. What a season this has been. It‚Äôs a historic one but not the way we thought it‚Äôd be. For all the criticism I have had along with all y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm sad to say farewell to so many aspects of this chunk of Nashville. We‚Äôve let go of beloved players as well as the man who got us those players. Once the reality of the road ahead set in, It was good to see the kids get their chance. It wasn‚Äôt the veterans or the execs that brought back the identity of this team, it was the kids. 

Not hoisting the cup isn‚Äôt necessarily a sign that a team or their season is a failure. Everyone wants to win but as much as I hate the clich√©, it‚Äôs not so black and white. The big win doesn‚Äôt happen without the cumulative successes of everyone. Embrace the mistakes because it builds experience and teaches lessons to carry forward from the guys on the ice to every one of us. To be the man you gotta beat the man and that doesn‚Äôt always happen because you were born with a gold spoon in your mouth that propelled you to be the intercontinental heavyweight world champion. Sometimes, it takes sticking to your guns and figuring it out.

We have a team that‚Äôs always worth fighting for(edit: we already did once when those douchebags tried to move the team). That team is part of a city that‚Äôs worth fighting for. It‚Äôs altogether part of the identity that makes us the best goddamned thing to happen to this planet since one of our dipshit single cell grandparents decided aerobic respiration was the way to go.

There‚Äôs always the chance that things might get worse, but I don‚Äôt give a shit. I‚Äôm too busy losing my mind with the best fans in the world while we watch the best team in the world. I wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way and from the bottom of my stone cold cast iron heart, thank all y‚Äôall for being there every step of the way.",KillerGoats,2023-04-15 03:38:48,"[('miscellaneous', 0.06)]"

Long time Preds fan and STH (2014-2021), long time lurker and first time post. 
I looked in the wiki and couldn't find it, so my apologies if this breaks etiquette. However, I think the boys have caught the attention of a lot of old fans that have moved away or watching less the last few years who want to watch the boys clinch a playoff spot and make a run. 

I live in Lawrenceburg and have Bally's Sports and been seeing Rodeo and all kinds of other shit on instead of the Preds. Was happy to see that they've been streaming on ESPN+ since my brother has an account but it says the games are Blacked Out in our area WTF?! 

So would someone be so kind to explain how I can watch legally free, legally paid, or otherwise üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è so I can watch the game tonight in TENNESSEE? TYIA

PS: I'm sure this has been said a lot lately but with the Sinclair bullshit it's time teams/cities own their own damn networks and include it in STH benefits so we can watch all the games without Jerry rigging a low latency stream with a 10 minute lag. That alone would've kept me and a lot of my buddies as STH and kept us engaged in the team instead of being blackballed from the fanbase due to RSNs. It would also engage fans who aren't STH and grow the fanbase with new fans. With Nashville now having a MLS team and wanting a baseball team, it would be great if a group like Ryman Entertainment, Haslams, and a few of the rich Nashville normies would start a digital omnichannel and broadcast the games for free OTA for Nashville cordcutters (Ryman/Circle ch 4.2) and on Comcast/Charter through carriage distribution like they do MLS.

694,12bafm6,My Top Coaching Candidates To Replace John Hynes as the Nashville Predators Coach:," I have compiled a list of my top coaching candidates to potentially replace John Hines at the conclusion of the current season. This list features a mix of seasoned veterans who are seeking a fresh start in their coaching careers, as well as promising young coaches who are eager to make their mark and establish themselves within the field.

&#x200B;

**Veterans:**

**Alain Vigneault** *(61 years old)*

* Points Percentage: 58.5%
* Playoff Win-Loss Percentage: 50.3%
* Stanley Cup Appearances: 2 (0-2)
* Made Playoffs in 63% of years coached
* Coached 100-point teams 42% of the time
* Jack Adams Award Winner (2006-7)

Vigneault is a strong candidate for head coach of the Nashville Predators based on his past achievements. He has coached several teams, including the Montreal Canadiens, Vancouver Canucks, New York Rangers, and the Philadelphia Flyers, and won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL‚Äôs top coach of the year in 2007. He is the Canucks‚Äô all-time winningest coach, with 313 wins, and under his leadership, the Canucks won back-to-back Presidents‚Äô Trophies and made one Stanley Cup Finals appearance. Vigneault is a modern strategic thinker who experiments with his roster, putting into practice modern ideas that enable his stars to excel. He is known for strategically adjusting his matchups to capitalize on the opponent‚Äôs weaker spots and gain an advantage and is among the best coaches in the world at using his resources effectively. Additionally, Vigneault has a strong record in player development, which he demonstrated when he managed to get more out of Vancouver‚Äôs prospects and young talent. If the Predators are looking for an experienced coach with proven success in the NHL, Vigneault is a great option.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Claude Julien** *(62 years old)*

* Points Percentage: 58.7%
* Playoff Win-Loss Percentage: 54.4%
* Stanley Cup Appearances: 2 (**1**\-1)
* Made Playoffs in 52.6% of years coached
* Coached 100-point teams 26.3% of the time
* Jack Adams Award Winner (2008-9)

Claude Julien‚Äôs success as a coach speaks for itself, with a points percentage of 58.7% and a Stanley Cup championship with the Boston Bruins in 2011. He has also taken his teams to the playoffs ten times during his career, with deep runs in several of those appearances. One of Julien‚Äôs strengths is his ability to create a structurally sound defense, which he does through solid structures and systems. He prioritizes defense first but does not sacrifice offense in the process. His Bruins teams were one of the better possession teams in the NHL dating back to the 2012 lockout. With a deep and talented forward corps and the best goaltender in the world anchoring his defense, Julien‚Äôs strategic preferences could be a perfect fit for the Nashville Predators. Under Julien‚Äôs guidance, The Predators could challenge for the Stanley Cup in a matter of years once their young core develops.

As a former Jack Adams Award winner and a coach of four different NHL teams, Boudreau has shown that he can lead teams to success in the regular season, with a winning percentage that ranks him second in NHL history for coaches with at least 900 games coached. He has consistently finished above .500 and has turned around struggling teams midseason, such as when he took over the Washington Capitals in 2007 and led them to their first playoff appearance in five years.

He has also won the Calder Cup and the NLA championship. Hartley‚Äôs style of coaching is defense-first, which could be a valuable asset for the Predators and fits their style historically. He is also known for being a strict disciplinarian, willing to bench even his star players for tardiness. His commitment to winning is evident through his tireless work and his outstanding motivation skills. Hartley could be a valuable addition to the Nashville Predators‚Äô coaching staff, perhaps taking their hockey club to the next level.

**Young Coaches:**

Another avenue is to recruit a promising young assistant coach who has been affiliated with successful NHL teams and has firsthand experience with winning cultures, strategies, and teams. With the newly appointed General Manager, Barry Trotz, assuming leadership, I believe that he could potentially mentor this coach throughout the entirety of the rebuild. All of the listed coaches will have substantial NHL experience, including time spent as a player.

Manny Malhotra, the former 7th overall pick in the 1998 NHL Draft, was widely recognized for his all-around play and sportsmanship throughout his playing career. He received votes for both the Byng and Selke Trophies on multiple occasions and won the OHL Scholastic Player of the Year award in ‚Äô98, as well as the Memorial Cup‚Äôs Most Sportsmanlike Player award the same year. Additionally, Malhotra holds the distinction of being the last active player to have been a teammate of Wayne Gretzky.

As a two-way forward, Malhotra was particularly known for his faceoff proficiency, winning over 56% of faceoffs he took in the NHL. After retiring from his playing career, Malhotra transitioned to coaching and was hired as an assistant coach for the Vancouver Canucks in June 2017. He later joined the coaching staff of the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2020, where he has gained valuable experience observing the strategies and tactics employed by successful NHL teams.

With several years of coaching experience under his belt and a deep understanding of what it takes to be successful in the NHL, Malhotra would be a strong candidate for a head coaching position.

Hello, my name is Nick and an active user in this sub. I am also a parent of two wonderful kids that attend the covenant school here in Nashville. Hockey has been an amazing part of my children‚Äôs year, especially my 5 year old who wanted to be Saros when he grows up (until today, now he wants to be a policeman). Unfortunately, There are lots of scared and confused kids tonight, and hearing my kids, it is going to take a while to process the events from today. What I do know is that they are still kids.

I am looking for anyone that might have contacts or connects to the preds organization to try and do something for these kids and bring them a little joy. The students will not have school this week and I know parents are having a hard time just processing the day let alone what moving forward looks like. 

Any connections or any ideas‚Ä¶ Ice skating for the families, kids meet gnash, see the locker rooms‚Ä¶ anything to let them be kids.

818,114ngen,Trade Suggestion: Kevin Lankinen for Philip Broberg (Edmonton),"Broberg was the 8th overall pick in 2019. He is an LD currently on their third pairing. He is a 6'3"" LD on his entry level contract. He would put us in a position that we could move Ekholm for other assets, and  still have a young LD for the future, which we don't have.

We are going to lose Lankinen after this season anyway as he is a UFA. We cannot afford to bring him back at what he will want. 

Edmonton desprately needs another goaltender, and Lankinen (.920 sv%) is having a great year. He would be a legit upgrade from Campbell who currently has a .888 save percentage. Broberg is a lot to ask for Lankinen, but Edmonton has to realize that they have a window with McDavid and Draisaitl that they cannot piss away with a Goalie like Campbell. Rumor is that they have been looking for Goalie upgrades. This is one they can actually afford.",MusicCityJayhawk,2023-02-17 15:04:43,"[('team performance', 0.11), ('coaching and management', -0.07), ('stadium amenities', 0.03), ('pricing', 0.07), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.02), ('media coverage', 0.04), ('miscellaneous', -0.05)]"

837,umbgc4,List of things that I would like to happen for this offseason.,"First of all fire DP I think we should go for a full rebuild and I don‚Äôt think he is quite the GM for that plus he just feels a little out of touch now. I would also love to see Karl Taylor move up to a Head coach and let go of Hynes. I think Hynes has been great at getting an identity going but for some reason the consistency isn‚Äôt there. If we are going full rebuild I think Taylor is the man for the job. He has done a great job developing the young players in the AHL. I think we need to find sign-trade options for Forsberg and try and get a first rounder if possible and a pretty decent prospect. I think tradable assets are Ekholm, Duchene, and Joey. I think their contracts are just a little too big and I think we should sell while they have decent value. I think we could get 1sts for each of these guys especially if we retain salary. Or with Joey a second and a prospect. I would like to just let the young guys develop. I would get rid of Cousins and Dave. Maybe even Boro and Benning just so we can get some youth back into the D-Core and let guys like Davies and Farrance get shots at being regulars in the NHL. For the love of god get Ben Harpur as far away as possible from this team. I think if we get as many young assets and picks as possible the more likely we will be to get top end talent. If we can get picks for this year‚Äôs draft and the next 2-3 drafts especially if we can get 1st rounders there are lots of players in those drafts that could instantly speed up this rebuild. I know Josi is going to get older but I just can‚Äôt imagine him waiving his NMC to get traded but anything could happen.",mk1700,2022-05-10 05:40:47,"[('team performance', -0.63), ('coaching and management', -0.42), ('media coverage', -0.21), ('stadium amenities', 0.12), ('stadium atmosphere', -0.06), ('miscellaneous', 0.13)]"

I know they got screwed in Game 6 of that Finals, but what makes him think he can continue to build for a deep playoff run when they get swept in the 1st round and that adding a 32, now 33, year old defenseman is the answer? He let Ben Harpur go, who has been great for the Rangers, puts Eeli Tolvanen on waivers, and apparently 5-6 days ago, he finally admits the team needs a rebuild!?!? Why is he still there? Also, I love physicality, but it seems like it's just being physical for the sake of being physical. I feel like the team is the American version of Calgary at this point.

844,vsaips,"New Jersey is listening to offers for the #2 pick, and we should call them","Whomever has that pick will either get Wright or Cooley, and either one could be our top center for a long, long time. Presuming that Cooley will be available, he could pay wing next year and that is a position of need for us. Cooley is only 5'10"", but so is Granlund. 

Or you could draft Slafkovsky, and have a 6'4"" legit scoring threat. If we resign Forsberg, then we would have a legit LW for the 2nd line. If Forsberg doesnt sign, we would have his replacement on the first line.

I have read that New Jersey would really like a goalie. When you consider that we have Askarov expected to arrive in the next couple of years, I think it would it make sense to trade Saros for the #2 pick. As a Vesnia finalist, I believe he would be worth the #2 pick for an even swap when you conisider his contract is $5MM/year with 3 years left. I love Saros, but the moment we drafted Askarov his days in Nashville were numbered. I don't think we will get a better return for him than we could with a deal like this. We could then find a bridge goalie in free agency, like a Marc-Andre Fleury, until Askarov gets here. 

We have virtually no chance of getting a top 5 pick in the forseeable future because Poile is committed to a 'competitive rebuild', so the only way we will get top level talent is to trade for a top pick. It is rare for any team in the top 5 to consider trading out of their spot. It is even more rare for there to be 4 players at the top of the draft that could all be drafted #1 overall in other years.",MusicCityJayhawk,2022-07-05 22:47:06,"[('team performance', -0.34)]"

Generally though, when situations don‚Äôt make apparent sense, there‚Äôs usually deeper details unknown. 

As I‚Äôm sure many who are frustrated know, Tomasino had a breakout season last year, gaining 32 points over 79 games. Easy to justify a Preds roster spot, especially over some of the other players we‚Äôve seen this year.

Philip is currently 21 years old. According to CapFriendly.com, the NHL‚Äôs waiver rules state anyone over 20 loses a year of waiver exemption if they play even ONE game. I don‚Äôt fully understand all of the wrinkles of the waiver system, but this seems pretty cut and dry. 

Tomasino currently has two years of waiver exemption left. That‚Äôs two years that no other team can take away an obviously young offensive talent. 

He also loses that exemption if he plays 81 more games, which could possibly be the 22-23 season. I know it doesn‚Äôt look that way, but it‚Äôs early folks. 

Back when the expansion draft happened, many fellow fans, including myself, were scratching our heads as to some of the players Poile decided to protect. 

We now know why these choices were made, and I‚Äôm sure anyone reasonable will agree, that those moves were risky, but smart. 

I also think most will agree that Poile has done a good job refilling our prospect pool, adding several promising skill players for the future of this team. 

If Poile doesn‚Äôt believe this team is fully ready to make a cup run this season, he‚Äôd be foolish not to take advantage of these kind of loopholes built into the rules. 

Regardless of anyone‚Äôs opinion of Poile‚Äôs tenure in the NHL, no one can deny his savvy for making the rights moves when most people haven‚Äôt a clue.

Anyways, looking to next year, there‚Äôs a lot of ways this can go. I for one, think if there‚Äôs any year to tank, this is it. Bedard/michkov are some of the best prospects since mcdavid (supposedly) and it‚Äôs pretty clear this core is past it‚Äôs prime. So, here‚Äôs my armchair gm takes for you guys.

‚Ä¢ keep the same bottom 6. Both the herde line and the diaper line (Tommy, glass, tolvy) I thought looked good. Especially that diaper line that can lead the charge in a few years. 

‚Ä¢ guys I‚Äôd trade/let go Forsberg, Ekholm, kunin, ryjo/ duchene. I can see both ryjo/duchene being gone under new management eventually. Could throw granlund in here but I‚Äôd like to see him stay for a few more years. 

‚Ä¢ UFA‚Äôs! With the cap space would save, we can make a run at some big time UFA‚Äôs that are young. Boeser, Necas, dach, Dubois?

Have you ever found yourself watching your favorite hockey player and thinking, ‚ÄúWow, I wish I could do that‚Äù? Well, do we have good news for you! In the Victory Hockey League (VHL) you have the opportunity to create your very own ice-hockey player.

For over 15 years, the VHL has offered people the chance to create, train, and manage their very own professional ice hockey player. As a forum-based hockey league, users can earn weekly experience points (TPE) either with a couple of easy clicks or by writing stories, creating graphics, and even producing podcasts. All of which can add to the story of your player. Once you‚Äôve earned these points you can apply them to your player. Want to be a playmaker? Load up on passing! Do you want to drive to the net with the puck on a string? Increase your Stick Handling and Deking. It's your player, your career, your choice.

One of the greatest parts of the VHL is that we are a diverse community of hockey fans who share a common interest in building players, creating stories, and watching our very own players make it to the Hall of Fame. As a user, you also have the chance to manage a team, create lines, negotiate contracts, and much more.

All of our games are run through the Simon T Hockey Simulator, and when the season is in full swing you can expect daily simulations, some chirping, and a lot of fun. Watch as your player grows from being someone no one knows in the Victory Hockey League Minors, to a rising star in the Victory Hockey League Europe, and finally a superstar in the Victory Hockey League.

No matter what, even if you just want to check us out, we have a great community of people who will help you learn, answer your questions, and may even become some of your greatest friends.

This is a perfect pass time for a long NHL Offseason! To find out more join our Discord server [https://discord.gg/pn8rkSuM](https://discord.gg/pn8rkSuM) and visit our website, [vhlforum.com](https://vhlforum.com/).",OfficialVHL,2022-06-13 00:22:00,"[('miscellaneous', 0.26)]"

890,11ga0xw,"I don't want to lose Saros, but if we are going to trade him, please let our trade partner be Buffalo.","If we are going to move him, I would love for our trade partner to be Buffalo. They have SOOOO many prospects in Buffalo, and plenty of picks. They are 3 points behind PIT for the last wild card postion, and Saros could absolutely give them a lift to make the playoffs. If they don't make the playoffs, their pick would obviously be worth more to us. 

Buffalo has a 1st and three 2nd round picks this year. 

It probably would never happen, but could you imagine if we got Owen Power and their 2023 1st for Saros? We could even send them McDonagh in the deal to give them the leadership they probably need in a playoff run and to fill Power's spot in the lineup. They have the cap space for McDonagh. They actually have enough young D-men that they can afford to lose him.

They also have the following prospects on The Hockey Writers top 100 list:

20. Kulich

23. Savoie

50. Ostlund

74. Rosen

As a point of reference, we only have the following:

13. Kemell

29. Evangelista

[https://thehockeywriters.com/nhl-top-100-prospects-ranking/](https://thehockeywriters.com/nhl-top-100-prospects-ranking/)

We could accelerate our rebuild by picking up players a little further along in their development than players we would draft this year. 

Take Kulich as an example. Kulich is an 18 year old with 33(15g-18a) points in 43 games in the AHL this year. As a point of comparison, Evangelista has 41 points (9g-32a) in 44 AHL games as a 21 year old. Kulich's production is nuts for an 18 year old. He also scored 8 goals in 10 games at U20 this year as an 18 year old. Kulich probably could play in the NHL next year, or this year if playing him in the NHL wouldn't kill his development. He will absolutely be a top 6 winger in the future.",MusicCityJayhawk,2023-03-02 18:30:13,"[('team performance', 0.0), ('pricing', -0.15), ('coaching and management', 0.21)]"

900,sut5di,Potential solution to the penalty problem?,"Ok, so we have a penalty problem. It's like we are chasing the white rhino and just can't enough of the box. It's a bit unfair. You know it, I know it, Hynes knows it.   


The problem isn't that the team is too physical or that the refs are being one-sided here. The problem is perception. We all saw the numerous missed calls against the Caps on Tuesday. It's because the refs weren't paying attention to US when the Caps were throwin' elbows. 

Our opponents are using the implicit bias of the refs to accentuate the penalties we are throwing, even when we aren't. I think this is where our opponents really shine. They are showing the refs exactly what the Preds are doing. There is no arguing that we are one of, if not THE most physical team on the ice right now. The refs know it and are look at our opponents to find those calls. Our opponents are helping them out by over-exaggerating silly stuff like taking a dive when a stick hits your skate. Looks like tripping if the ref is looking at the fall and not the skate/stick.   


How do we combat this? Well, my first thought was to engage with the Nashville SC to get some tips. All joking aside, though... what profession makes a living with seemingly real fighting? Professional wrestling. The Preds need to hire whoever trains these guys (Ask Seamus, he seems to really like us!) and get some acting lessons for our team. This isn't to fake penalties. I'm not condoning cheating. What this can do is change the perception of the team in the league and ref's eyes. If we can show that our opponent is being just as physical as we are, then we should see a reduction in BS calls made against us. We are throwing just as many penalties as our opponents, but the bias of the refs is preventing them from being objective about it. Turn the tables and show that the opponent is doing the same stuff we are and we can get back to playing real hockey. The kind where it's ok to fight every once in a while.   


The Preds are a tough team. Like, really gritty. They can take a hit. That's hurting us. It's ok to take the hit AND THEN go down to the ice. You get back up and shake it off. (Shake it off!) If it looks like the other team isn't hurting you, the refs will be conditioned to see that the penalties aren't there because it didn't impact your ability to keep playing. Act like it hurts and get some empathy from the refs and then take your power play and put pucks in nets.   


If anyone on the Preds reads this and thinks ""Wow, this dude has a point"" and wants me to take the post down so others don't come trolling for our strategy, DM me. I'm happy to do it, but you know, hook it up... I'm a size section 105 Row A in season tickets... or maybe just some glass seats to a few games for helping reduce the penalty mins. haha",mleyd001,2022-02-17 16:42:31,"[('team performance', 0.05), ('coaching and management', -0.22), ('miscellaneous', -0.12)]"

I‚Äôm aware that there‚Äôs an internal cap the Preds are operating off of but seriously, if you can grab any one of those three you‚Äôve really added some real help.  If you get Laine that‚Äôs a scary first line, you get Copp or Palat that‚Äôs a really good second line and still a scary first line with Duchene and Forsberg.  You get Palat and Copp?  You‚Äôve got really good lines 1-4.  Would you want to play that team?

919,uwuk5s,"How to ""blow it up"" to rebuild","This will not happen - Poile has made it clear he will add to this team and attempt to get back into the playoffs. It's worth pointing out that I don't want this to happen. However, if we had to, here is how I would ""blow up"" this team in order to maximize future return through acquiring picks and prospects plus deliberately tanking for the next 2-3 seasons. 

The ultimate goal is to: acquire as many picks as possible unless a Grade A prospect is available, give young players as much ice time as possible, and generally be terrible. The aim is to be a playoff team in 3 seasons and a Stanley Cup winning team in 5-7 seasons. 

To fill roster holes I can only use players who are currently in Milwaukee: Askarov, Ingram, Glass, Afanasyev, Farrance, Myers. Or bring in cap dump players to acquire picks. 

**Overview:**  
Currently the Preds have $25,887,191 in cap space for 2022-2023 season. We are currently below the cap floor and need to spend at least $60m.  
The Preds have one 1st round pick and two 3rd round picks. We do not have any second round picks.  

**OUT:**   
Forsberg - he does not fit the plan of a rebuilding team as he is too old and wants too much money. The focus is on youth.  
Joey - Retain $4m of his contract in order to increase value. Worth at least a first.  
Ingram - He can get a great return to a cap-crunched team who needs a solid back up. Should be a solid prospect in return plus a high end pick. Askarov is in the wings so we don't need a long term solution at the moment.   
All free agents not on RFAs: Grimaldi, Cousins, Benning, Harpur, Rittich. Plus Luff.   

**IN:**  
Cody Glass - takes Joey's spot on the 2nd line.  
Myers - has a spot as our bottom pair D.  
Afanasyev - gets a trial run but spends the year in the AHL.  
Mike Hoffman - cap dump from Montreal. 33 year old winger on a $4.5m/year deal. Last year Hoffman scored 15 goals in 67 games.  
TJ Oshie - Cap dump from Washington. 35 year old winger on a $5.75m deal for another 3 years. Last year he potted 11 goals in 44 games!  
A couple of Cousin's level grinders on cheap deals who are 4th line / healthy scratched. 

**Re-signed:**
Anyone with a RFA tag: Glass, Kunin, Trenin, Lauzon. Even if you don't like them, they're young and under team control and get another year as a trial run. 


Our new team: 

Tolvanen - Granlund - Duchene  
Tomasino - Glass - Hoffman   
Trenin - Sissons - Jeannot  
Oshie  - McCarron - Kunin

Josi - Fabbro  
Ekholm - Carrier  
Myer - Lauzon  
Boro  

Saros  
Back up  

There is it! A team that straddles the cap floor and is built to lose. Obviously this is not the direction of the team but I imagine this is what it would look like if we did move forward.",Unknown,2022-05-24 16:17:28,"[('team performance', -0.2), ('coaching and management', 0.1), ('media coverage', 0.04), ('stadium amenities', 0.07), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.04), ('pricing', 0.2), ('miscellaneous', -0.02)]"

954,113ahmz,Tankaton Watch,"Tired of watching this dump and chase team lethargically limp towards missing the playoffs? Here is your guide to reveling in our collapse: the TANKATHON WATCH.

The Preds currently sit in the 15th overall draft spot. But we can do better! While the quest for Bedard is all but over for this team, a first line quality player is in the cards. 
Bedard is billed as an elite, generational talent on pace or potentially better than McDavid. But players as low as 4th overall are being projected as NHL All-Star talent. Even the 10th overall pick is projected as a top of the line up / high-end 2nd line player. 

The top 7 spots are pretty locked in at this point but if the Preds try hard they can end up with as high as a Top 8 pick. But how do they do it? 

**1) Lose, you assholes.** The Preds need to start losing games ASAP. The Preds currently on are pace to get 1.098 points per game (BAD!) - for an estimated total of 90 points. If we project out every team's point per game pace over 82 games, the Preds will need to be under 80 points this season in order to get 8th over all. Which means they can only get .75 points per game from here on out. 

**2) Win, you assholes.** Alternatively, the Preds also need other teams to start winning games. Here is who we are competing with: Philly, St. Louis, Ottawa, Florida, Islanders, Det, and Buffalo. 

Philly - Torts already committed to a rebuild (BAD!).  
St. Louis - Seem to have committed to a rebuild by trading Tarasenko (BAD!).  
Ottawa - After trading for DeBrincat this off season, they are probably still going for it (GOOD!).  
Florida - They do not own their draft pick and have no reason to tank (GOOD!).  
Islanders - Just spent big money on Horvat. Will not tank (GOOD!). 
Detroit, Buffalo - Probably too good, should end up more in the middle (HOPEFUL!).  

In my mind, with just a bit of a push towards the bottom, the Preds can easily get a 10th overall pick and a glimmer of a chance for a cheeky Bettman lottery win. This is THE draft to compete in and the Preds can't let the pride of the playoffs get in the way of our long term success.",Unknown,2023-02-15 22:29:33,"[('team performance', -0.76), ('coaching and management', -0.54)]"

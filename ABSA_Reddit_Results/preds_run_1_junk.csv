**Scouting Report:**

There are smooth skaters, there are explosive skaters, and there’s Tanner Molendyk. Every game is a masterclass in some element of skating, whether that’s turns, cutbacks, speed, or lateral movement. That mobility could make him the surprise challenger for the draft’s top defenceman down the line.

A quick series of crossovers launch Molendyk past multiple opponents; it doesn’t matter if he’s moving forwards, backwards, or laterally. At full speed, he changes directions with sudden outside edge cuts, heel-to-heel skating, and tight turns.

With that skating, Molendyk stays in opponents’ faces non-stop. Even speedier, skilled opponents struggle as he instantly claims the middle, forces them wide, then darts across for the steal in a blink of an eye. His stick work’s precise, and his hits heavy. Undoubtedly, he’s one of the best rush defenders to come through the last few drafts.

Then, Molendyk goes on the attack. Part-dynamic rusher, part-passer, he carves up the forecheck before sending a team up the ice with a long-range pass. He makes every play in motion to instantly join the rush. There’s little doubt that he will continue to outskate opponents in the NHL, and he could do so much more.

“*He can beat defenders off the point in so many different ways: fake shots on pass receptions, faking inside to the outside, stop-start deception, head fakes, and so on,*” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American scouting Mitch Brown wrote in January. “*But he never commits to it. As soon as the defender closes a bit of space, he hits the brakes and throws the puck into the corner. He doesn’t read the opponents’ feet, it seems, which leads to turnovers (sometimes) and missed opportunities to create (often).*”

As the margin for error shrinks with each step up the ladder, being able to squeeze the most out of every inch of space counts more and more.

Of course, Molendyk doesn’t have to become a dynamic play-creator to reach the NHL. That’s the benefit of being a dynamic play-killer with breakout skill. But if he can learn to exploit the opportunities his skating creates, there’s a real chance he’s a complete, minute-munching defenceman inside a team’s top-four.

**Industry Chatter:**

“*Elite skater. Probably the fastest player in the draft. Guys can’t touch him when he has the puck between the blue lines. I think he’s a pretty good defensive player too. Hands and brain need to catch up to his feet though.*” – Eastern Conference scout, May 2023

**24. Nashville Predators:** **Tanner Molendyk**, LHD, SASKATOON (WHL)

February 3, 2005 | 5′ 11″ | 181 pounds

Tier: Middle of the lineup player

**Player comparable:** Mario Ferraro

**Background:** Molendyk has played a ton of minutes for a strong Saskatoon team this season. He hasn’t put up big point totals but often isn’t on PP1 for them. He led Canada in ice time in their Hlinka semifinal win over Finland and was second in ice time in the gold medal win over Sweden. Molendyk grew significantly in a short period of time. He measured in during the summer at 5-foot-10 and 3/4 inches and is close to six feet now. He was the fifth pick in his WHL Bantam Draft.

**Analysis:** Molendyk is a strong two-way defenseman despite not being the biggest defender. This is because of his excellent skating ability and strong work ethic. Molendyk’s edgework is very good. He closes on checks like a pro and is able to evade pressure at a high level. His top speed is good, not great, but he can lead a rush in the NHL. Molendyk has strong offensive instincts and skills and can make plays from off the blue line and on the move. His size will be a minor issue as a defenseman in the NHL, but he plays hard and doesn’t shy from physical play often landing hard hits at the junior level. I think he checks a lot of boxes and projects to be a top-four defenseman.

**Thoughts on the pick:** Tanner Molendyk is a favorite of mine. He’s an outstanding skater who plays hard and I think moves the puck well enough too. He’s not the biggest guy, but he reminds me of guys like Alexander Romanov and Mario Ferraro, and I think he could be a second-pair defenseman. After being a defense factory for so long, Nashville hasn’t invested much draft capital of late high on defenders, so this is a much-needed boost to their system.",Unknown,2023-06-30 21:36:32,"[('skating', 0.95), ('shooting', 0.23), ('passing', 0.08), ('puckhandling', 0.27), ('hockey sense', 0.23), ('physical', 0.27), ('transition', 0.89), ('offence', 0.87), ('defence', 0.94), ('player comparable', 0.42), ('industry chatter', 0.61), ('background', 0.27), ('analysis', 0.71), ('thoughts on the pick', 0.72), ('comments', 0.12)]"

495,14a3qpg,We're no longer Private or Restricted as a subreddit.,"[During our initial announcement of participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Predators/comments/143nx54/rpredators_will_be_going_dark_from_june_1214_in/), we received overwhelming positive feedback, with the primary response to the 48hr protest suggesting that we make the protest indefinite.

Throughout the blackout where most communities went dark, I was personally disappointed with the lack of action by Reddit to correct their course. I was an active Digg user right up until they dug their own grave through less-egregious moves than we're seeing Reddit make today (in my opinion.)

After the 48 hours, the biggest criticism of the protest was that ""no protest with an end date will ever change anything."" Some of the mods who were initially against anything beyond 48hrs seemed to agree with this sentiment, leading to our move to Restricted.

When we went Restricted, we heard some of you criticize the decision to do this without preparing any announcement beforehand, or allowing anyone to voice their opposition before the Restricted setting was active. This still allowed people to comment in the post about it, and some of you did comment. As near as I can tell, a similar number of you commented your vocal disapproval for any post-48hr participation as did initially support the indefinite blackout.

We mods of course would have loved to have a poll to refer to and assure that we're making the right choice by the majority, but at this point, the most-committed users to the blackout would have never seen the poll, and the vocal critics would be over-represented in the results - a pretty interesting dynamic, if you think about it.

To those of you who say that no protest should have taken place, as nothing would have changed - I respond that this is view is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Take no action, and you can be sure you get no reaction.

To those who perhaps wished that we stayed private in solidarity to help affect change - I suggest you find the biggest community that you frequent which is still private, and message the mods that you support their protest. If our little subreddit for a sports team in the off-season had users spinning off their own new subreddits to fill the apparent void, just imagine what mods of the larger subs are dealing with.

496,149by7s,"r/Predators is back, but we'll be in ""Restricted"" mode for a while","(most of this has been shamelessly stolen from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1495wpj/askhistorians_is_back_up_but_currently_restricted/))

We’re back! Well, almost. As many are aware, as part of the site-wide protests we closed the sub for the past few days. While we have taken the subreddit off of ‘Private’, it is now going ‘Restricted’. This means that no new submissions can be made except by mods, and comments are limited. We know people still have questions, so we’ll be addressing some of them here:

**How long will AskHistorians be Restricted?**

We don’t have a specific end-date, and reopening is intertwined with several factors which we are continually weighing. These include: what response, if any, we see from reddit; internal discussions by the mod team about how we, as individuals, are feeling about things; and evaluation of the changes that are happening, how they will impact our modding, and how we can adapt to deal with them in a way which allows us to continue to moderate the sub.

**Why are you Restricted? Why not just stay private?**

While we went entirely private for two days as part of the reddit-wide blackout, many participants are in favor of a longer period of protest, and so are we. But we want to find a balance to ensure it is as effective as possible, and we believe that reopening in ‘Restricted’ mode does so. It still puts pressure on the Admins by signaling our position, but also allows us to reach a much bigger audience by having this and our previous statements more easily accessible, amplifying the message to more users.

In addition, it opens up our archives for users to read past posts, but limits other discussions which also emphasizes what is being lost when we are unable to run the sub.

**What Happens Next?**

We don’t know what the final results will look like, nor can we make any promises beyond the fact that we will continue to act and be guided in our decisions by what we believe is best for the community. We will continue our internal discussions and evaluations, and provide periodic updates to the community as we deem appropriate. We dearly hope circumstances will allow us to reopen fully very soon.

While the above covers the core issue of the Blackout and Locking of the sub, we’ve had a few questions which keep getting asked either in previous Meta threads, or in modmail the past few days, so we’re also addressing them here:

**I completely missed what is happening? Can you fill me in on the background?**

Last month, reddit announced changes to their API which impacts certain third-party apps which provide critical mod tools, especially on mobile. You can find our previous statements [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Predators/comments/143nx54/rpredators_will_be_going_dark_from_june_1214_in/). We would also recommend [the recent coverage in the New York Times for a broader look](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/business/media/reddit-subreddit-blackout-protest.html).

**Can I get access to the subreddit? Pretty please?**

While we have moved the subreddit off of Private, it remains Restricted. In practical terms, only Approved Users can post in a Restricted subreddit, and Approved Users are pretty much limited to Mods. We understand that many of you have news you want to post, and recognize how frustrating it can be when the mods take longer to post news or something, but we are not planning to make exceptions. We hope that we will be able to unlock soon and things will return to normal.

**Will you be going somewhere else?**

Not at this point. Maybe in the future. There are some interesting alternatives to reddit cropping up in the Fediverse (like [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/)), but they are small at this point. Obviously, there are boards, groups, channels, etc on other platforms where you can find communities of Predators fans.",pwnicholson,2023-06-14 16:15:27,"[('restricted mode', -0.68), ('reddit-wide blackout', -0.63), ('api changes', -0.39), ('reopening in \\restricted\\ mode', 0.34), ('reddit blackout/protest', -0.27), ('mod team', -0.12), ('subreddit off of private', 0.0), ('reopening fully', 0.28), ('feedback received pre-blackout', 0.03), ('restricted mode indefinitely', -0.57), ('effort to support an offline action and hindered protest', -0.32), ('third-party app creators', 0.12), ('offline actions', 0.21), ('subreddit shut down', -0.54), ('moderators', 0.01), ('people on the internet', 0.09), ('purchase of third-party apps', 0.03), ('blackout', -0.38)]"

840,116y6gn,The Great Depression,"After becoming a Preds and first-time hockey fan in February of 2020, I realize now that I've chosen the Chicago Bears (of whom I'm also a fan) of the NHL. I just don't understand how a team can hold onto a GM who acts like Ken Holland (even though most of his success, if not all, is due to Devellano) and yet doesn't have a Stanley Cup to show for his efforts. I know they got screwed in Game 6 of that Finals, but what makes him think he can continue to build for a deep playoff run when they get swept in the 1st round and that adding a 32, now 33, year old defenseman is the answer? He let Ben Harpur go, who has been great for the Rangers, puts Eeli Tolvanen on waivers, and apparently 5-6 days ago, he finally admits the team needs a rebuild!?!? Why is he still there? Also, I love physicality, but it seems like it's just being physical for the sake of being physical. I feel like the team is the American version of Calgary at this point. I know Bill Haslam is supposed to be taking over as the owner, but I don't really see a hardcore conservative making a big change. Is anyone else feeling this way, or am I the only one who feels this team is doomed until 2030 or longer?",Unknown,2023-02-20 04:59:43,"[('blaming the management for mistakes and the lack of a clear rebuild plan', -0.49), ('perceived pricing out of loyal fans', -0.15), ('lack of media coverage for the predators', -0.12)]"
844,vsaips,"New Jersey is listening to offers for the #2 pick, and we should call them","Whomever has that pick will either get Wright or Cooley, and either one could be our top center for a long, long time. Presuming that Cooley will be available, he could pay wing next year and that is a position of need for us. Cooley is only 5'10"", but so is Granlund. 

Or you could draft Slafkovsky, and have a 6'4"" legit scoring threat. If we resign Forsberg, then we would have a legit LW for the 2nd line. If Forsberg doesnt sign, we would have his replacement on the first line.

I have read that New Jersey would really like a goalie. When you consider that we have Askarov expected to arrive in the next couple of years, I think it would it make sense to trade Saros for the #2 pick. As a Vesnia finalist, I believe he would be worth the #2 pick for an even swap when you conisider his contract is $5MM/year with 3 years left. I love Saros, but the moment we drafted Askarov his days in Nashville were numbered. I don't think we will get a better return for him than we could with a deal like this. We could then find a bridge goalie in free agency, like a Marc-Andre Fleury, until Askarov gets here. 

We have virtually no chance of getting a top 5 pick in the forseeable future because Poile is committed to a 'competitive rebuild', so the only way we will get top level talent is to trade for a top pick. It is rare for any team in the top 5 to consider trading out of their spot. It is even more rare for there to be 4 players at the top of the draft that could all be drafted #1 overall in other years.",MusicCityJayhawk,2022-07-05 22:47:06,"[('management', -0.04)]"
855,10g6mvf,Tonight is the final game for the Reverse Retro 2.0 jerseys.,"I, personally,  am happy that they will be done after this game. I honestly think Adidas dropped the ball on both of our Reverse Retro jerseys. There was so much potential to them, and they kind of half assed them. Although the “Mustard Cat” RR jerseys were much better than the first ones. Still wish they would’ve done a navy jersey. 

This will also likely be the last alternate jersey worn by the Preds in the “Adidas Era.”  The NHL’s contract with Adidas expires at the end of next season, and it was announce a few months ago that it would not be renewed. And so far there’s only been 2 names thrown out to replace Adidas, CCM or Nike. CCM currently supplies the AHL and CHL(major Junior) jerseys along with producing equipment. Nike does the International jerseys and has every other major pro league in the US/Canada (NFL, MLB, & NBA). I would say Nike is probably the most likely candidate for the new ones.",Seib7290,2023-01-19 16:51:57,"[('adidas jerseys', -0.79), ('navy jersey', 0.48), ('ccm', 0.54), ('nike', 0.39), ('reverse retro jerseys', -0.07), ('mustard cat 2.0', 0.14), ('overall jersey design', 0.01), ('stadium series jerseys', -0.66), ('jersey logo', 0.2)]"

After further digging I verified that all Global Series travel packages this year are managed by this vendor.

44,13ni924,A titans tattoo I got done last month in memory of my daughter who passed away last year.,"My daughter passed away on April 24th, 2022, so I got this a year later. She loved playing peek-a-boo with my hats, and this particular hat was the one I wore at the hospital where she passed. Several hours before she passed, she had woken up when we thought she would not wake up again, and immediately reached for our hats while we were crying and started playing peek-a-boo with it. She would hold the hat and drop it below our face so we all yelled out peek-a-boo when she drops it. She was smiling and laughing at it like not a care in the world. She probably played for up to 10 minutes before she fell back asleep and never woke up again. She would pass just hours later at 18 months old. 

I got this tattoo on April 25th of this year, and I've had one touch up done but I think it's got a little more to go because the shading of the front and bill of my hat is light gray and my skin doesn't seem to want to absorb the ink very well. Anyways, thanks for reading this if you've read it",broccolibush42,2023-05-21 04:00:23,"[('miscellaneous', 0.24)]"

I know a lot of you have given up hope already. And I don't blame you. I had, too. But then I woke up feeling like it was time to Titan the fuck Up.

Matt Neely wouldn't be in here asking about future QBs or OCs right now. He'd be posting memes about tomorrow's game or the inherent comedy in making the playoffs with a losing record. There's plenty of conversation to have, fun facts to share, and jokes to tell about tomorrow's matchup.

I know it may feel like a lost cause, but do you think Marcus Mariota let the fact that it was a lost cause drag him down on this day five years ago when he led our guys back from a 21-3 deficit at the half, starting the scoring with [one of the most improbable plays](https://youtu.be/Or82E31eReM) in franchise history?

Is this team going to win the Super Bowl? God, no. But is the Super Bowl really the only reason anyone watches football?

This is a storied franchise with a lot of history. And this franchise has exactly one streak of making it to the playoffs more than three years in a row. And that streak ended with the 1993 season. Tomorrow, this team has the opportunity to get to the playoffs a fourth year in a row. This is the kind of stuff decades of Titans fans before us dreamed of.

And we're in here blathering about Tim Kelly, Aaron Rodgers, and potential draft picks. Pull it the fuck together and let yourself get excited.

The playoffs are here for our team in early January, as they should be. Win and advance. Get stoked and Titan the fuck up. 

Like every football season, you'll miss it when its gone. And you'll probably wish you had let yourself enjoy it a bit more while it was still here.",neimsy,2023-01-06 14:44:31,"[('team performance', 0.56), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.22), ('miscellaneous', 0.16)]"

195,17qr26g,Just watched the presser today from Levi’s and Tannehill… woof.,"I missed Vrabel’s part, but Levi’s seemed confident. Spoke well, and seemed like he recognized his role as a rookie starter, while giving due respect to Tanne. Now, Tanne, on the other hand… that was rough to watch. It doesn’t seem like he agrees with the decision, by the way he avoided answering some questions. Granted, the questions were harsh. “Did you see the writing on the wall after the Raven’s game?” “No. Not initially”. They even asked him about how he felt about how the playoff game vs Cincy effected his resume. He stared something along the lines of “just hoping the fans and this city are grateful for when I came in, and turned the city around and won some football games”. The man has given his HEART to this organization and his teammates. I’ll forever be grateful for that man, but it sucks to see him down in the dumps about it. Hope he’s able to rally, dump some knowledge off to Levis, and maybe go play one or two more good seasons of football elsewhere.

For this week, we will be donating to the Elephant Sanctuary located in Hohenwald, about an hour and a half outside of Nashville. Their mission is to  provide captive retired elephants from circuses and zoos with care, companionship, and sanctuary as well as educate the public of the complex needs of elephants in captivity and the crisis facing elephants in the wild. Elephants are extraordinarily intelligent creatures, capable of distinguishing between human languages, using tools and even mourning their dead in addition to their renowned strong memories. Unfortunately, there are only \~40,000-50,000 elephants worldwide left around the world with some species even being marked as critically endangered with their main threat being poachers that harvest their tusks as well as habitat loss. Elephants make up not only a keystone species for their ecosystems in Africa and Asia, they also provide value to local communities through tourism and other sources of income.

219,182zosx,25 Seasons Of Titans Football,"&#x200B;

I posted this on twitter thought i'd share it here.....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since 1999 the Titans have had.....

&#x200B;

215 victories (Near top ten)

 13 winning seasons 

 10 playoff berths 

 7 seasons 11 or more wins 

 5 division titles 

 3 times AFC #1 seed 

 2 times NFL best record 

 3 AFC title game appearances

 1 Super Bowl appearance

 2 2,000 yard rushers 

2 NFL Offensive Player Of The Year

1 NFL Offensive Rookie Of The Year

1 NFL Defensive Rookie Of The Year

1 NFL Comeback Player Of The Year

1 NFL MVP

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Overall i think the Titans have done pretty good over the course of their first 25 years and for a long time have hovered in and around the top ten in total victories and had the leagues best record on two different occassions.

From 1999-2003 the Titans won 61 games winning more games than any other team during that span. 

The Titans set a record winning their first 13 home games in their new stadium The Coliseum or aka The Tomb of Doom

The first ten years 1999-2008 the Titans were top five in the NFL in total victories and only New England,Indy,Philadelphia and Pittsburgh won more games. They also had an NFL defensive rookie and offensive rookie of the year during that time. 

The drafting was top notch when Floyd Reese was GM and the team drafted Jevon Kearse,Keith Bulluck and Albert Haynesworth those first years in Nashville. Letting WR Derrick Mason go was a big mistake but they were in salary cap hell at the time. 

Chris Johnson was a really good pick by new GM Mike Reinfeldt in his second draft in 2008 and the next year CJ ran for 2,000 yards and set the NFL record for most yards from scrimmage with 2,509 yards a record that still stands as CJ is the only NFL player to ever gain over 2,500 yards in a season.

In 2011 they brought in Matt Hasselbeck and at the time i wish they would've waited on drafting a QB as Jake Locker had accuracy as well as injury issues. Hass led the Titans to a winning record that year and of course the next few years there would be a rough period before things got on the right path again.

2013 one of the few things GM Webster did right during his tenure was signing Delanie Walker one of the best TEs the team has had.

In 2016 JRob took over as GM and did well starting out getting the team back winning again bringing in RB Demarco Murray and drafting Derrick Henry along with safety Kevin Byard.

In 2018 Mike Vrabel took over as head coach and his first four years he had winning seasons winning a couple division titles and appearing in an AFC title game.

In 2020 Derrick Henry had a 2,000 yard season rushing and Titans are the only NFL team with two seperate 2,000 yard rushers.

Last season and this one the team is dealing with the fallout from JRob and his bad decisions in drafting as well as trading AJ Brown.

Hoping our new GM Ran Carthon can right the ship.

I also hope Levis development goes well due to the O line issues at the moment.

Looking back over the teams first 25 years we had an entertaining team that had some really good players at times and came close several times in the postseason. No other team in the league had better RBs as Eddie George,Chris Johnson and Derrick Henry were all excellent and CJ as well as Henry has shattered records with so many long TD runs including Henry's 99 yard run which in 2018 was the longest in NFL history along with Tony Dorsett's 1983 run.

I've been a Titans fan since day one in 1999 and the only really tough stretch was 2012 through 2015 four straight losing seasons and thats the longest stretch they had without a winning season. 

I couldn't imagine being a fan of a team like Jacksonville where they have had just 4 playoff berths since 2000 and have had 14 seasons with 10 or more losses.

We are knocked at times for not winning a title but i think the Titans will get titles in the future and our time will come.

There have been several times the Titans have had chances to win a title but fell short and the latest one was 2021 against Cincy turnovers doomed us just like in 2008 and 2000.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm hoping lord willing to be here for the next 25 years and during this stretch we will definitely hoist a couple Lombardi's......

242,181gqsv,Why I'm iffy on Brock Bowers,"I've seen a lot of people talking about what the Titans should do if MHJ and the top left tackles aren't available when they draft. A lot of people have been saying that Bowers would be a great option to give Levis a weapon who will also be a good blocker.

While I like the idea of Brock Bowers,  drafting a tight end in the first round hasn't worked out great for nearly every team since Greg Olson in 2007. *I'll preface this by saying I'm going solely off offensive statistics like catches, TDS, and yards - and not blocking. I just think if a TE is to be drafted this high, they need to be a great pass catcher.*

2021 - Kyle Pitts - Had a really good rookie season in terms of yards, but has not been looking great since, but may be too soon to tell . (maybe it's scheme? coaching?)

2019 - T.J. Hockenson - pretty solid, but 1st round talent, especially top 10? 

2019 - Noah Fant - decent, but not making any waves.

2018 - O.J. Howard - even had Tom Brady for a couple years and was an average TE at BEST. Big disappointment considering the hype.

2017 - Evan Engram - good rookie season but that has been his peak.

2017 - David Njoku - fine at best. Hasn't had 700 yards or more than 4 TDs in a season

2014 - Eric Ebron - one really good season that came in year 5 - 13 TDs and 66 catches (both career highs by far).

2013 - Tyler Eifert - only 1 season with over 500 yards and/or 5 TDs and they came in the same year. Crushed it with 13 TDs.

Hindsight is 20/20, but would you spend a 1st on any of these players? Especially with the shape of our roster?

The best tight ends in the league like Kelce, Kittle, Andrews, etc., were pretty much all drafted in rounds 3 or later.

Good morning all. Making my first trip in to attend a game in person in Nashville (been to the two in London) after 2 decades watching the team.
It's my birthday weekend plus Panthers game seemed the one game we might have a chance to win 😂

Just wanted to ask a couple of questions and also leave this open for any tips for places to go. We're here Thursday to Tuesday night. Gonna visit the Up/Down bar and the Johnny Cash museum, as well as a couple of people we made friends with when they came over for the Chargers game.

Biggest question; is there wine sold in the 100/300 seating? My partner is coming along, and although she loves rugby, has never got into the NFL. So kind of need to make sure her drink (white wine) is available during the game 😁😁 Is that only available in club seats? (I've not bought tickets yet)

Otherwise, can't wait to see Nashville for the first time. Staying downtown.

It's this look. This look on his face, every time the camera shows a close-up of him each week. This look like he's surrounded by idiots and he's in utter disbelief of how any of this can happen. You know it, you've seen it so often now, he barely moves due to the supposed incompetence of others. 

When he first joined this team, this was a look reserved for dumb calls by the refs. He freezes, staring, not moving, with a face like he's either in deep pain or about too fart. ""I can't believe what I'm seeing"", ""Why do I have to deal with this?!"", ""Amateurs!"". At the time I liked it, it could really show distain without needing to scream at the refs, as they screwed stuff up.

Now, it's every game, every other play, defense and offense. A look of shock like it's a complete surprise to him the team is bad, that he's been a part of leading them to this place.

Why does it piss me off so much?

It's because, as a player, how could you play for this expression? How can you give it your all, when you're already struggling and looking for guidance, after looking to the sideline and seeing this staring back at you? This frozen glare of dumbfound disbelief from the man who is supposed to be guiding you, teaching you, helping you.

I couldn't play for a leader who has given up, I don't get how anybody on this team can. We're not a strong team, a deep team, there are so many problems, but nobody is even close to being lifted beyond their level by this guy, as all he has to offer them is this stupid face. 

It's time for a leader, this one has checked out. He's decided he deserves better than idiots.    ",AntlPop80,2023-11-20 22:16:42,"[('team performance', -0.56), ('coaching and management', -0.36), ('media coverage', 0.01)]"

Obviously the 49ers and Eagles are the best examples for this model and everyone is aware.  We potentially have the QB moving forward even though its impossible to evaluate any QB behind this line.  As far as the draft pick, we are clearly approaching one of the top picks.

My main question is, was it Carthon's goal to roll out one of the worst possible rosters this year.  I know it sounds very tin foil hat, but next year the Titans are creating the best environment for rebuild (Tons of cap space, cheap franchise QB, and high draft pick).  If you were a GM and had to come up with a 5 year plan, how would you have approached this year?

281,17zuxl2,Levis Performance,"At this point in the season, the only thing that's worth watching the games for is to see Levis's development. That's what made last week's game against TB so frustrating, not the loss, but Levis having zero chance to do anything. This week looked like it was going to be more of the same until, mercifully, they let Levis cook a bit in the 4th quarter. Surprisingly, Levis's stat line ended up way better than I would have thought. The 13/17 for 158 yards is not impressive, but the 9.3 yards/attempt, 2 TDs, only 2 sacks taken (felt like more), and rating of 143.8 all stood out as a much better performance than what I would have thought just watching the game. 

Obviously, most of his stats came in garbage time, so take them with a grain of salt, but it felt like Kelly and Vrabel finally said ""fuck it"" and took the training wheels off and let him play, and that's when he started making plays. I truly think the conservative game plan with a lot of runs, screens, and passes behind or near the line of scrimmage is an attempt to keep him safe because of this Oline, but I really hope that with what we saw at the end of this game, they stop with that nonsense and let him play his game. I think that constantly getting into 3rd and 7 because your super conservative plays get you 4 yards on first and then a loss of 1 on second down is putting Levis in far more dangerous situations than letting him play free and try to make plays down the field. 

I'm just happy we got to see something from Levis this week, and hope to see more of that going forward. 6 TDs to 2 Ints for a Rookie's first 4 games isn't bad, especially considering the state the rest of the team is in.

282,17zu4nm,We are a bad team with just as bad coaching atm,"Not going on a fire vrabel rant.

 A piss poor talent starved team with a nonexistent O line and a secondary made out of Swiss cheese will certainly lose games nobody can argue that. Howeverrrr just bc we have no talent doesn’t excuse the play calling and coaching decisions that are being made. On the bright side I want us to lose out at this point but it’s a major concern for next year. I don’t mind losing but the way we lose is disgusting. They continue to call plays that don’t work and refuse to try anything different aside from a couple gimmick plays here and there. We can’t block yet we’re constantly calling screens, horrible route selection that takes forever to develop which again since we can’t block why keep doing it, the penalties especially on 3rd down for the defense are constant and that’s all discipline which I think comes down to coaching as well. I could continue but we all know the issues if you’re still psychotic enough to watch us play. Why do we refuse to call quick plays that aren’t called screens , why not some slants , why not quick developing routes WE KNOW THE O LINE IS GARBAGE why continue to call plays that require some level of blocking knowing that blocking will not be there. They’ve got to stop showing their hand with Henry / Spears it all but tells the opposing DC what we’re going to do. Our team constantly being injured is on the S&C coach as well. It’s just total ineptitude in all aspects rn. I’m fine with losing when you have a bad roster but like I saw someone else say you should at least look like you’re playing the same sport. Levis could be our guy but he’s being set up to fail. They refuse to try anything new instead it’s “hey let’s keep doing the same fucking thing that doesn’t work”. 

My thing is losing due to a talent disparity is fine I never expected us to be good this year, but we’re being out coached just as much as outplayed (which is great for the tank) but the years after this it’ll be what is holding us back bc the best talents can only make up for so much poor coaching and one dimensional play calling. I would feel so much better about the future if we were losing but the playcalling and coaching was there and it was just an issue of not executing due to bad players. Instead we have bad players getting put in schemes and plays that make them even worse then they already are. We will never have the perfect 99OVR team and that’s an issue 99% of coaches must deal with and they have to come up with a gameplan to get the most out of their bright spots and coverup for the weak points, that’s what makes a coach good - doing better then the sum of your parts and that is something that is the opposite of what is happening. Vrabel and ppl in the sub can blame the players all they want but personally I think coaching is similarly responsible for the shit results. 

We don’t have a good team we have glaring glaring issues on both sides of the ball but we don’t have an entire team of talent starved bozos out there we have talent , might not be a lot, but we have some and the few bright spots we have are being snuffed out by the coaching. That has to change or else it does not matter one bit who we draft and who we sign. Jrob fucked the titans raw no lube but that cannot continue to be the excuse as to why we look as abysmal as we do. It seems vrabel and his staff have banked on the players overcoming poor playcalling with raw ability and when that falls off it exposes the root cause of the issue and that’s what we’re seeing now and if that continues the upcoming seasons will continue to have middling results. I don’t want vrabel fired but there has to be drastic change and the ability to adapt and I hope he’s capable of putting ego to the side and really addressing the issues that ARE in his control.",givemecap,2023-11-20 17:41:31,"[('team performance', -0.45), ('coaching and management', -0.34), ('pricing', 0.0)]"

The game is trending toward QBs being dual threats more and more.

Ironically thats the QB the Titans have usually drafted through the years McNair,VY,Locker,Mariota,etc.

I like Levis from what i have seen only one thing bothers me is injuries.

He even missed crucial time this preseason due to an injury.

This might put me in the minority but this is what i would do.

I would take Drake Maye if he is available when we pick.

Otherwise if Maye is gone take a left tackle or wide receiver.

If Maye is available i would definitely pick him BUT i get the feeling they will stay with Levis.

287,17zhmxe,The Tanker's Guide to Week 12,"Well, this week went pretty well for us in regards to tanking this season. The Rams and Packers both won while Denver started to pull away from threatening us in draft capital. Nonetheless, there are still seven weeks of misery left before the first 18 spots in the draft order are calcified, so let's get into it.

NOTE: I understand that u/firefighteremt19 did a post on this topic several hours beforehand; I just wanted to wait until either late tonight or Monday to post my own thoughts with everything laid out. The Eagles @ Chiefs game won't affect the math all that much beyond SOS, which when in doubt, we want the NFC team to beat the AFC team. With all that out of the way, let's get into it.

**Tier 0:** **What this entire scenario is based off of (i.e. disregard if we win)**

**Panthers** @ Titans: Our opponent is the frontrunner for the first overall pick, a pick that they foolishly traded away to get the worst rookie QB currently starting. Unfortunately for us, the Titans have scored a staggering 27.3 points at Nissan (would be 6th in the entire NFL) while the Panthers are allowing a pathetic 27.5 points per game (3rd worst in the NFL, same mark as their points scored per game). Vrabel is 6-2 against Frank Reich when the latter doesn't have Andrew Luck. Here's a chance to really establish our spot in the top 5 of the draft; let's go out there and lose this game.

**Tier 1: Games with teams we can pass this week**

**Patriots** @ Giants: I was briefly tempted to pick the Giants due to their harder upcoming schedule compared to New England's, but I decided not to risk it. We're looking for Olu or Alt, not one of the top two QB's. New England isn't that much weaker in terms of SOS, so there's a good chance to pass them.

**Bears** @ Vikings: The Vikings blew a chance to really establish themselves in the Wild Card race with a Josh Dobbs disasterclass. Meanwhile, Chicago has a higher pick than us and is currently picking higher than us with their own selection with the same number of wins as us and a weaker schedule with Justin Fields returning to nearly upset the Lions, a team that will likely be in the Divisional Round if not further. The Vikings are pretty far away from us in the draft order, so this is about as cut and dry as any game you'll find on this week's docket.

**Tier 2: Games that cushion our pick**

**Packers** @ Lions: Green Bay did well for us beating LA, lowering their draft pick and our SOS. The Lions almost lost to Chicago, so they aren't exactly unbeatable. Furthermore, they haven't won on Thanksgiving since the Obama administration, so there's a chance for Green Bay to put some distance between us in the draft order even for Love's own struggles.

**Commanders** @ Cowboys: Put some distance between us and Washington for that pick in case we happen to win another game. Neither really affects SOS although Dallas did play a common opponent in the Chargers. Nonetheless, the Cowboys are in no position to threaten our tank while the Commanders are.

Dolphins @ **Jets**: The Jets are also looking for offensive line help, so here's hoping they stay away from our draft spot and take down a common opponent in Miami for our SOS.

**Bucs** @ Colts: Beyond the simple reason of FTC and shooting down their playoff hopes, this will put some distance between Tampa and us for draft selection. There's literally no reason to not root for Tampa to win this game.

Steelers @ **Bengals**: Joe Burrow's out for the year, so Cincy's Super Bowl ambitions this year are done. Furthermore, the Bengals have fewer wins than the Steelers even if the former has a stronger SOS than us. I'd prefer not to worry about tiebreakers in the event that the Bengals slip.

Saints @ **Falcons:** The Falcons have one more win than us while New Orleans has two. In case we win another game, less damage done to our draft position always helps, which a Falcons win provides.

Jaguars @ **Texans:** If CJ Stroud gets injured for the season, the Texans are three games ahead of us with the weaker SOS while the Jags are four. The calculation demands Houston continue their dominance over Jacksonville.

Browns @ **Broncos:** In addition to SOS, putting Denver two wins ahead of us while weakening our SOS due to Cleveland being a shared opponent renders this a clear-cut practical choice to say nothing of how much the Browns deserve to have nothing but failure.

**Rams** @ Cardinals: Again, I thought about putting the Cardinals into a position to where we could pass them but see Pats @ Giants entry for why I decided not to. We just passed LA for draft position, so here's hoping they go on a win streak even if Kroenke should go to the deepest circle of Hell.

Chiefs @ **Raiders:** KC's in the driver seat for the #1 seed. Vegas has only two games over us with a weaker SOS. Enough said.

Ravens @ **Chargers**: Strengthens the schedules of the Pats, Bears, and Packers with Baltimore unlikely to challenge our draft positioning. FTR

**Tier 3: Games that matter for SOS mostly**

**49ers** @ Seahawks: We play Seattle next month, so a little bit of SOS weakening for us is always welcome. I anticipate Seattle making the playoffs due to how weak the NFC is, so this is why the weaker opponent isn't wanted to win.

Bills @ **Eagles**: Only one AFC team is ahead of us, and they played Philly. The Bills could absolutely implode with their schedule, but that's unlikely to occur with their bye week after this one.

**If all goes according to plan:**

We would have the 3rd overall pick. Only the Cards, Giants and Bears would be ahead of us in the draft order. We can assume that Williams, Maye, and Harrison will be the top 3 picks, so beyond that, the draft is our oyster. Take your pick of Fashanu or Alt and run.",YiMyonSin,2023-11-20 05:50:27,"[('team performance', 0.01), ('media coverage', -0.06), ('miscellaneous', 0.01)]"

289,17zdj2r,Money…,At the end of this season we won’t have Tannehill but as with Henry becoming a free agent I’m wondering… do we let him go and use the available funds to completely overhaul this team? That would give us a lot of disposable income to really taylor our offense to Will and fix a few gaps in the defense as well? I’d really like to see the King stick around and retire a Titan but that will come at serious cost. Idk I’m just tired of seeing us get beat the same way over and over and that was just a way I think we could fix it.

290,17zcvjy,Titans currently sitting #6 in the Draft,"Well that was a great game wasn't it? The Titans need talent period and the only way to get some more is high draft picks. The best chance for the Titans to get talent is to somehow get into the top 3 for picks. The 5 teams ahead of the Titans are #1 Panther 1-9 (Bears), #2 Cards 2-9, #3 Pats 2-8, #4 Bears 3-8 and #4 Giants 3-8

So how do the Titans get better picks is by losing and rooting for others to win. Lets see what we need to happen for week 12.

Panthers @ Titans - **Panthers** \- This one is easy need to get the Panthers closer to their 3rd win. After the Titans the Panthers still have the 29th easiest schedule left with games against the Falcons and Packers. The Panthers pick goes to the Bears so the further back they go the better so the Bears don't trade the #1 pick again for another player and 2025 1st.

Rams @ Cards - **Cards** \- The Cards have looked so much better with Murray back. Cards have the 8th hardest schedule left in the NFL.

Pats @ Giants - **Pats** \- Need the Pats to get to 3 wins and they have only one other game that they should be favored in which is week 18 against the Jets. But it would be the Bill way that they end with the #2 pick and he retires but sets them up with their next Franchise QB. Maybe the Pats trade for Vrabel too.

Bears @ Vikings - **Bears** \- Bears choked away a win today that would have got them to 4 wins. With Fields back on the field they looked improved. Bears also have games against the Cards, Falcons and Packers.

Titans can not win anymore game this year to secure a top 3 pick. A 4th win will cause the Titans to start tumbling because of the high SoS they are carrying. 4th win with their SoS would drop Titans to early teens. Titans currently have a .544 SoS and there are only 3 other teams with higher SoS are Cards, Bengals and Ravens.

&#x200B;

Also I want the Titans to use that Top 3 pick on MHJ. You need to have multiple threats at WR and unfortunately Burks having multiple concussions that have ended his first two season just means he will play the next two year but will not be brought back or will be traded. Your not going to find ABJ in the second round all the time, your more likely to find Justin Hunters.",firefighteremt19,2023-11-20 01:31:21,"[('team performance', -0.05), ('coaching and management', -0.29), ('media coverage', 0.06), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.29), ('pricing', 0.16), ('miscellaneous', 0.13)]"

Be ignored and in nothing short of scientific phenomena. A 1:2 syllable ratio in their names. It does not work with 2:4 syllable ratio or else Jimmy G would have some hardware other than sitting shotgun to Brady. This also bodes well for the future of the AFCS, considering none of the other QBs follow this trend; so my estimates estimate that they will fade to irrelevance within the next few years.

325,17x25is,Does Jeff Fisher get too much blame for Vince Young flaming out?,"Whenever I see anything related to Vince Young a common sentiment among fans is that it was Fisher's fault. That Jeff Fisher did not like Vince and actively wanted the guy to fail. I know that Vince was forced onto Jeff by Bud Adams and that he wanted a different qb. They butted heads alot and there were lots of moments where things came to a head like that scare in 08 after Vince got benched and of course  Young throwing his pads into the stands. I know Fisher isn't without fault but what about Vince?

Vince Young was an extremely gifted athlete. He can turn nothing into something and had at multiple times took control of games by himself. He is front and center on a few of my favorite moments in Titans history. However he wasn't the brightest, scoring only a 6 on the wonderlic which is one of the lowest scores ever. An Nfl playbook is pretty complicated and so is reading defenses. Vince struggled with both. He was also known to lack a strong work ethic. Not Jamarcus Russel bad but not the kind of work ethic you expect out of a franchise qb. 

In games he struggled to be a consistent passer regularly throwing duds and at times pretty confusing passes. A lot of that could be attributed to his unique throwing motion which never got coached out of him. After leaving Tennessee he played for few other teams not even able to make the final roster on most of them before his career just quietly ended. 

Vy was an amazing athlete but I don't think he had the mental necessary to play qb. Had history been different and he went to a different system would he have became the star everyone saw in him after the rose bowl game? I don't think so. What do you guys think? Especially those who watched during that era. I was 8 when Vince got drafted so my memory on that era of the Titans isn't razor sharp.",Titan5005,2023-11-17 00:28:23,"[('coaching and management', -0.22)]"

What is the biggest FA signing (outside our own players) we've ever had? Malcolm Butler? I know we have a ton of cap space, but I remain skeptical that we will land any of the top players available at premium positions. We are going to have to overpay someone like Tee Higgins to convince him to come here (if he is even available) - do we really think the Titans ownership will be willing to do that? It would be a shift from what we have ever done before.

I see us more realistically chasing value and signing some solid additions rather than overpaying for the best of who is available. Knowing the Titans, we probably wind up giving $20 million a year to Devin White as our big addition.

356,17uvk1f,The Tanker's Guide to Week 11,"Losing sucks. Stunning revelation, I know. The NFL hates it so much that they created a system where the biggest losers are at the front of the line for the best players from across college football entering the pros. With this in mind, our abusive partner in Titans football needs more talent coming in following several disastrous offseasons, and one of the most effective ways of doing so is to draft studs for our roster. So which games do we need to worry about for this week to improve our draft pick? Bear in mind that we are 1-0 this season when I post these sorts of guides, so just assume that we lose this week and avoid getting our hopes up. Furthermore, my default assumption will be that we are looking to draft either Olu Fashanu or Joe Alt, the two consensus best tackles in this draft class and strong experience at left tackle, where we've given up 14 sacks through 9 games through a butcher's table of free agent whiffs and draft busts.

Titans @ **Jaguars**: Given. There's a lot here to suggest that the Jags will win this game: they're coming off a humiliating loss to the 49ers, we're averaging a pathetic 12 points per game away from Nissan Stadium, tape on Will Levis, the Jags just being a flat-out more talented roster, lots of reasons. For as hilarious as it would be to mock the Colts as the only team to lose an away game in Jacksonville and shut these jerks up, the tank rumbles on over such emotional desires.

**Bengals** @ Ravens: Cincy is far closer to passing us in the draft order than Baltimore is. Also FTR.

**Bears** @ Lions: Everyone loves the Lions. Likable team, larger than life coach, fun offense, these are all aspects one can find endearing. Regardless, Chicago has the same number of wins as us and in prime position to pick Fashanu or Alt with their pick. With the dearth of quality blindsides in free agency, we need to improve our draft pick as much as possible, and a win for the Monsters of the Midway will help tremendously.

Chargers @ **Packers**: Assuming a Titans loss, the Packers are another team that stands in our way of getting Alt or Fashanu. As an added bonus, a Chargers loss weakens our SOS in the event that we tie with another team in overall record. Good to have in our back pocket.

**Raiders** @ Dolphins: A Dolphins loss will weaken our SOS just like a Chargers loss. Furthermore, if Vegas implodes down the stretch, this provides a bit of a cushion if we do win a game or two more.

**Cardinals** @ Texans: A Cardinals victory will give them the same number of wins as us, weakening their pick and potentially giving us a shot at Marvin Harrison Jr., one of the most surefire receiver prospects this league has seen since Calvin Johnson. Did I mention SOS for a Texans loss and that they could be looking to get a new left tackle?

**Giants** @ Commies: See Cardinals @ Texans as to why but forget SOS for this.

Cowboys @ **Panthers**: See Cardinals @ Texans. Nonetheless, the Panthers are on the docket in two weeks, so a weaker SOS is a nice consolation if Dallas wins. Don't worry about this game.

**Buccaneers** @ 49ers: Put some distance between their pick and ours. Again, a lower SOS in a Tampa loss also helps assuming we also lose. 

**Jets** @ Bills: These crazy sons of guns could always trade up and snag Olu or Alt, so some more distance is always welcome to increase the price. Who doesn't want to see Josh Allen miss the playoffs this year? FTB

Seahawks @ **Rams**: The Rams share the same record as us and the Packers with their own worries in the trenches. Get out of here and give us a lower SOS while you're at it, LA. No brainer.

By the end of this hypothetical scenario, Tennessee will sit with the 5th overall pick in the draft. The top 3 will be a combination of Williams, Maye, and Harrison with another pick that will likely go to Fashanu or Alt, depending on what team prefers whom, with an outside chance for Bowers. That leaves plenty of room for us to swoop in and draft our man.",YiMyonSin,2023-11-14 05:46:08,"[('team performance', -0.13), ('coaching and management', 0.13), ('media coverage', 0.16), ('miscellaneous', 0.17)]"

Look at Belichick's press conference from yesterday: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuhvz0i5dna) . At best he mentions ""we"" and ""everyone"" needing to perform better. A pointed question about his job security was deflected.

Frank Reich: ""We win and lose as a team"": [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8n3zzvxkyq) He did say 'I'm the head coach, it starts with me,' but then started talking specifics about players again. Is that what you want to see? Just the exact right coach-speak in every interview?

Robert Saleh: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orr1uz2b0lg)

Dennis Allen: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycj9k_flae)

Mike Vrabel: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzyxx60la5y)

It's all the same. The same questions, the same responses. Coaches may throw in a rote response of ""it's all on me"", but then they move on to the next question. Answers will never be found in interviews.

Losing coaches feel bad. They mumble, they are low energy. That is the exact same thing that happens to 50% of all teams, every week. What do you want from a losing coach? Do you want them to tear their shirts and wail in grief?

But now comes what I think the real question: has Vrabel lost the locker room? This is what you should be asking. Does his attitude, whatever it is behind the scenes, affect the players? Can we draw a line of causation between Vrabel's behavior and the players around him looking cowed, quiet, lacking energy? I'd say not yet: there are hints of energy this week: Derrick Henry's frustration, Jeffery Simmons mouthing off, everyone seemingly excited for starting Levis.

When the rumors start that someone on the inside says that Vrabel has lost the locker room, X player wants to be traded away, players publicly complaining, or misbehavior/acting out by players, then it will be plain to see.

Of course, this all says nothing about his actual coaching ability and game-time decisions.

372,17ueum7,2024 Draft: Offensive Tackles,"The game this week was demoralizing but I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to dwell on the negatives. Life is too short to spend it ruminating about negative things you can't even control, IMO. There absolutely is plenty to complain about and criticize, but I'm still optimistic about the long term prospects of the organization. So this week I'm looking forward to the 2024 draft.

I think the first round pick has to be OL because it's the worst position group on the team, by far, and there won't be any good OTs available in free agency. No team in its right mind trades a franchise OT unless the trade is so lopsided you can't turn it down (Laremy Tunsil is the most recent I remember, and is a big reason the Dolphins are so good now).

Looking at mock drafts the consensus seems to be there are 3 OT worthy of being a top 10 pick, Fashanu, Alt, and Latham. Consensus seems to be that Fashanu is the best of the three, but I don't know enough about any of them to have an opinion. Does anyone knowledgeable have thoughts on this? Should I be hoping the Titans lose enough games to draft Fashanu?

I'll still be watching every Titans game hoping they win and viewing the better draft position as a consolation prize from losses. There will be lots of losses regardless of how I feel and hopefully those losses are more competitive than the abomination yesterday in Tampa.",Papplebeast,2023-11-13 16:47:28,"[('team performance', 0.36), ('stadium amenities', 0.0), ('coaching and management', 0.36), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.0), ('media coverage', 0.19), ('miscellaneous', 0.01)]"

375,17ucsl5,Rest of the Season Outlook,"Alright folks its time to have a honest discussion about what the rest of the season will look like. The Titans are 3-6 and are not going to be making the playoffs this season currently sitting at the #8 spot in the draft. However if the Broncos lose tonight that would push the Titans to #9 as they have a weaker SoS than the Titans. Now last year the teams with the top picks only had 3 wins. This year I believe that any team with 3 wins is already out of the top 3 when it comes to picks. So how many wins do we really think the Titans will finish with.

Week 11 - @ Jags - **Loss** 

Week 12 - vs Panthers - **Win/Loss**

Week 13 - vs Colts - **Win/Loss**

Week 14 - @ Dolphins - **Loss**

Week 15 - vs Texans - **Loss** 

Week 16 - vs Seahawks - **Loss**

Week 17 - @ Texans - **Loss**

Week 18 - vs Jags - **Loss**

So I believe the Titans will finish with between 3 to 5 wins. Last year 5 wins kept you in the Top 6 for picks. However we have to remember that the Titans SoS is going to be inflated this year due to the Texans and Colts doing better and then on top of it the AFC North is all having a great year. The only benefit is the NFC South is bad as it is pulling down the SoS.

Teams I believe that will end up with top 3 picks, Pats, Giants and Bears.",firefighteremt19,2023-11-13 15:15:04,"[('team performance', -0.13), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.01), ('pricing', 0.22)]"

402,17sacwc,My theory on why the defense gets bad when the offense gets good,"The reason the Titans can only have either a good offense or a good defense at any one time is due to two factors: a) our depleted roster, and b) Vrabel's desperate attempts to keep the Titans viable. 

In the past, and even this year, Titans go with the run game in order to burn clock. We're lucky Henry is here, but I think Vrabel would do some variation of this scheme even without him. Vrabel would rather run the clock out in a close game than attempt to close a game out by balling out because that means that our defense would give opponents another chance to score. This means that our opponents PPG is low overall. You may notice in the past few years, that our per-play stats are not as good as our *overall* game stats. The years we have a low PPG, come from what we think is ""unsung greatness"". And we, the fans and analysts, crow about our defense (when it is good) like we are actually elite. We're good, yes, but it is Vrabel's scheme that puts the defense over the top.

Our defense mindset plays into it as well. Against the Steelers, we played deep, but let Pickett dink and dunk us into scores. But that takes time off the clock, thankfully, a lot more than getting burned over the top. We are vulnerable on the deep ball when we go man to man, and being burned would posterize Vrabel's players and give opponents a higher score. 

So what happens when we get good on offense? We score, we use less time per drive. Which gives the opponent more drives per game. Then *they* score more per game.

All this means that Vrabel is a *great* coach. (But also great and hiding the things that would make him look bad.) He's doing the best he can with a bad roster; worse than we think, actually. He's limiting the opponents' scores, and hoping beyond hope that we can simply score more efficiently, instead of getting out there and taking more offensive risks. 

The real culprit, the real reason why the defense gets bad when the offense gets good, is drafting and recruiting. JRob is gone but his stink remains. He gambled and had some big scores, but came away from the blackjack table in the red. And Vrabel is doing everything he can to overcome it - by cheating the clock on offense in order to keep defense off the field. 

This is why we dislike our OC's playcalling, no matter who it is. Until we are comfortable with Levis slinging the ball, Vrabel is going to misdirect attention away from the defense by slowing the game down. He probably dictates individual calls to the OCs, keeping the run/pass ratio on the run side, one eye constantly on the clock.

So when the offense gets better, the defense will get worse, guaranteed. And we will continue to be on these balancing scales until we truly draft and sign enough players good enough for a stalwart defense.",InsanoVolcano,2023-11-10 18:26:48,"[('team performance', 0.04), ('coaching and management', -0.19)]"

439,17qqvh8,My Gut Feeling,"I think the official announcement of Levis being QB1 going forward has us all feeling pretty good and excited, even if we don't expect much from the team this season. I, for one, am letting the excitement get to me and have a gut feeling about a few things that are not really based on anything other than my feelings, and what I would like to see. 

First, I think this is the week we finally see Dillion Radunz play LT. Vrabes, in the presser yesterday, said that every scenario regarding the Oline was a possibility and it would depend on who is available. He was also pretty complimentary of Radunz's versatility, specifically saying he has played well at both guard and tackle. I know the running theory is that Radunz is in Vrabel's dog house for some reason, but I think it's more of a situation where Vrabel likes to have a reliable backup that can come in and play any position, but I think the plan this week, if Hubbard can play, is to have him back at RT and Radunz at LT. 

Second, and this is the bigger one, I think with Levis officially being the guy, we finally start to see the offense come together. I know Kelly wasn't limiting the playbook for Levis, so I'm not saying he opens it up, but I do think the gameplan against the Steelers was a very conservative, quick reads, and screen pass game in order to try and neutralize their pass rush. Against teams with much less formidable pass rushes, I think the plan will be more around Levis's strengths, and doing more play action shots, kinda like the ATL game. We've seen some flashes of what this offense can be, like vs ATL and Cincy, and I think with Levis executing it better than Tanny was, we see it much more consistently. Also, Levis is going to finally get us over 30 points in at least one of these games.

476,17ovbcx,Just my thoughts about the possibility of firing Vrabel if he doesn't start Levis next week,"Vrabel earned Coach of the Year after leading the most injured roster in the league (and it wasn't even close) to the first seed in the playoffs.

Vrabel wanted to keep AJB because he knew the damage it would do if we didn't keep him, and he was right.

Vrabel benched Mariota for Tannehill in 2019 because we had an actually good roster that he knew wasn't playing up to its full potential unless Tannehill was put in.

All that to say, he has been right about everything so far.  Trust the process.  If he benches Levis, I trust that he has his reasons, and I suspect those consist of the fact that we do not have a competitve roster around Levis like we did in 2019.  Levis is 100% a breath of fresh air over Tannehill, but he could understand that us fighting tooth and nail for a 1 and done in the playoffs and a lower pick in the draft isn't the move.",TheWetNapkin,2023-11-06 05:03:00,"[('team performance', 0.01), ('coaching and management', 0.12)]"

484,17on7qt,The case for firing Mike Vrable,"1) I think Will Levis is the real deal. I think he can be as special as any QB we have had since being in Nashville. Having an offensive minded coach will help him. Someone that can develop him. Young Qb always benefit from a good offensive mind. 

2) look at the past Super Bowl coaches 

Andy Ried vs Nick Sirianni

Sean McVay vs Zac Taylor 

Bruce Arians Vs Andy Ried 

Andy Ried vs Kyle Shanahan 

Bill Bellchick vs Sean McVay

Doug Peterson Vs Bill Bellchick 

All of them with the exception of bellchick are offensive minded. And even bellchick I think you have to make an exception for because he had Brady.

3) If Vrabel had some mastermind offensive coordinator, it be little better. But he dosent. He hire’s underwhelming offensive coordinators that he hires within instead of outside the organization 

4) The culture is the titans has always be physical run first. Dominate the line of scrimmage. Well we don’t do that. When last time the offensive line dominated. Additionally it’s a passing league. Run first teams without a good passing game do not win.

5) He a defensive coach. Witch means you think we be a top defense. Are defense has only had one top 10 finish and that was his first year. This should be his strength and it’s a weakness 

2023: 20th ranked defense 

2022: 23rd ranked defense 

2021: 12th ranked defense 

2020: 28th ranked defense 

2019: 21st ranked defense 

2018 8th ranked defense 

Probably get downvoted.

493,17o0wgm,Levis article w/ childhood stories,"So I found this random Levis article from just before the draft, “Even in middle school, NFL draft prospect Will Levis was gifted leader: 'Throw a little slower” the article itself sucks it’s littered with ads and typos. But check out these stories from people who knew him as a child.

In talking with a couple of people who knew Levis as a young teen, they describe a middle schooler who was already a leader with preternatural poise.

He also already had an arm.

“At recess, we allowed the kids to play football,” said Chris Wallack, the school’s former athletic director, who’d sometimes be the teacher out at recess. “We had fifth and eighth graders together. The first few times we went out with Will, everybody wanted to throw the football around. He threw so hard – not purposefully – so hard, he knocked down some kids.

“A private school, there were parents who probably wouldn’t have let their kids play football, with concussions or whatever, doctors. I remember having to tell him, hey, when you’re throwing to the fifth graders, you’ve got to throw a little slower.”

John Fixx, now head of school, arrived at the Country School in 2013 so was only around Levis for one year. He made an impression.

“We knew when he was here he was going to take a leadership position,” Fixx said.

Wainio said that Levis was the kind of guy who always had a smile, who had a big laugh. And none of that took away from his poise or tenacity.

“We were losing to a team in basketball by about 16 points at halftime,” Wainio said, “and Will came out in the second half and scored 32 points, in a middle school basketball game. That was my first notion that this kid had something a little different.”

Wallack remembered meeting with Levis’ parents after Will was cut from Madison’s top travel basketball team to the B-team. He said he told them that they had a motivated youngster and a little adversity might make him stronger.

“And hey, he’s also going to play Country School basketball,” Wallack said. “He can take out some of his frustrations at being cut.”

A few weeks later, in the first game of the school season, Wallack said, Levis scored 43 points.

“We were a school where the whole team might not score 43 points in a game,” Wallack said. “He had a great two years. the B-team thing, I think it worked out.”

Wallack remembered Levis as a pretty good lacrosse player as well.

“He was pretty good at everything.”

All three described a magnetic personality that helped make Levis a leader. He was popular with his other students, Fixx said, but had something more, was able to plan ahead.

“When others could fall off the rails and be typically eighth-grade silly, he focused on maintaining appropriate comportment,” Fixx said, pausing to get that last word. “Deportment and comportment. He showed me a maturity beyond his years early on. He was a leader that way.”

Wallack said he talked with other coaches about the idea of Levis taking the Wonderlic test, similar to an IQ test that was famous as an NFL evaluation tool for draft prospects.

“I don’t know if they still do that, but if they did, this kid, he’d get 100 or whatever that score would be,” Wallack said. “He’s a smart kid, a really good kid. Skills aside, we think he’s got the fortitude, the motivation to be a very good NFL quarterback.

“He’s such a nice kid.”

Consider for a moment, that Mike is trying to develop his young QB with these media responses and decisions. Will was known to be cocky.

A helpful thought experiment- pretend for a moment that Vrabel is very intentional and doing the right thing for the team and then reevaluate everything he says for an ulterior motive. 

None of us know Will or the team as well as the coaching staff. That’s a fact. 

For all we know Vrabel may start Tannehill to develop Will further. There’s something to be said for not letting your rookie QB get smushed by our awful O line play as well. 

These are ideas it seemed the collective consciousness of the sub used to acknowledge. I remember people saying we are “ruining” Malik behind this O line. Where is that thought for Will?

I remember people acknowledging that Vrabel was a leader of men. Suddenly he’s a favorites playing loser who likes losing?

We all said the season is shot, now being patient with Will is us surrendering the season?

It just doesn’t add up.

That said… the play calls at the end of the game sucked. I think the run on 3rd and 4 was us outsmarting ourselves. And as painful as it is to admit — Will sucked that series. Not in that he didn’t make plays, but in that he was hurling the ball into the hands of the Pittsburgh D and looked lost.",thanoski,2023-11-04 14:34:27,"[('coaching and management', 0.33), ('team performance', -0.35), ('media coverage', -0.08)]"

513,17n4ooa,What Vrabel is talking about with Levis,"https://youtu.be/BQ7a0qhK8EE?si=18obB4NJJIHWzWNs

There were absolutely some spectacular plays in there, and a lot to be excited about as a Titans fan. He has a cannon and can make off platform throws into tight windows. He had some smart decision making. *However*:

There's a pass at 4:02 that should've been picked.

Can't see well enough but looks like the next pass at 4:10 might've been that way as well - can't tell without the all-22.

There's a pass at 5:27 that should've been picked off.

There's a pass at 6:41 that should've been picked off. But that's basically equivalent to his other pick - if he gets picked here, the other one doesn't happen, so it's kind of a wash, but the concept is still the same of mistakes being made.

And that's not even talking about his almost fumble when he tried to throw it while being sacked.

Those are just the plays that probably should've been turnovers that he got lucky on, and I'm not even talking about missed reads or errant throws. But he should've had a stat line 0 TDs and 3 INTs if the DBs had anything less than bricks for hands. 

He's a rookie. He's going to make mistakes. He didn't get punished for those mistakes this game, but that doesn't mean he didn't make them. I'm not saying we shouldn't continue starting him, but for everyone in the other threads that's bitching about Vrabel having come criticism for his young QB, this is why. The stat line does not tell the whole story, for better or for worse.",saudiaramcoshill,2023-11-03 20:48:22,"[('team performance', -0.76), ('coaching and management', -0.17)]"
514,17n4hjx,This team is not a qb or coach away from being a contender. The sooner you accept that the sooner you can see what this team actually is.,"Will Levis is great but realistically what will he be able to do with this roster? He is not singlehandedly going to transform this team over night. His second best receiver is Nick Westbrook Ikine. His oline is completely in shambles. The only position group on offense I think is solid is the running backs but they can't do it all. 

On defense we have a dline that could not generate pressure on Pickett. Possibly the worst group of DB's in the league and linebackers have mostly been ok but nothing remarkable. 

It's bewildering to me that people want Vrabel gone because he isn't able to turn Chicken shit into Chicken salad. Has Vrabel been without fault? No but here is the thing. No coach ever will be. Bill Belichick is also struggling with a bad roster and he is the greatest coach of all time. Andy Reid gets questioned on his play calling all the time. Kyle Shanahan has struggled in his tenure as 49ers coach. Did the 49ers make the wrong call sticking with him even after he only won 10 games in his first two years or when he had a 6-10 season the year after going 13-3? I'm sure there will come a time when the Miami Dolphins have to let players go or they see some key injuries and suddenly Mike McDaniels won't be the genius he is currently touted as. Not saying he is bad coach but maintaining success at an NFL level is incredibly difficult. It relies on so many different factors coming together that makes it really easy to fall apart. 

At the end of the day this team isn't good and you guys have to accept that. Firing Vrabel is like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. Vrabel has had 1 and a half bad seasons. It's crazy how quickly the fanbase is ready to move on from him knowing the roster is in the shape its in. For what it's worth this years draft is looking like its setting the foundation for years to come. Skoronski, Levis, Spears, and even Whyle all look like solid picks and with all the cap space we'll have 2024 might be a great year for us. It still a long ways to go so until then we just have to be patient and understand that this year isn't going anywhere.",Titan5005,2023-11-03 20:39:45,"[('team performance', -0.69), ('coaching and management', -0.54)]"

524,17n0yzd,What is the dream off-season you’d like to see for us?,"Me personally, I want to hire Ben Johnson as our HC. I like Vrabel, but I think we need to change to an offensive minded coach to get the most out of Levis and give him consistency. In FA, I would like us to sign Tee Higgins and Jaylon Johnson, as well as another decent corner, and make a trade for Evan Neal. A lot of people see Neal playing bad and think that’s just him, but it’s because he’s put on the right side, when he is a LT. I believe he can be a franchise LT, especially if Ben Johnson brought in a guy similar to the lions oline coach, because they’re oline coach can develop players pretty dang good. Next comes the draft. If we can get Marvin Harrison Jr, you take him, but I would love to get Brock Bowers. I know TE seems like a luxury pick, but he is probably the best TE prospect we’ve seen in a long time. Bowers is an elite blocking TE and one of the best pass catchers in the country. His ceiling is insanely high, and Levis could really use a safety blanket. Then draft a 2nd round speed WR. Other picks I won’t go into detail with, but I’d like to see more oline, corners, and LB’s being drafted with those later picks. If MHJ and Bowers are both gone, you draft a LT or Corner. I know this is all not gonna happen, but I’m so excited about the future. Let me know what you guys would try and do if you were our GM!!

Will Levis looked great to me. 2nd ever game, on the road against the Steelers, and he never looked overmatched. I'm trying to temper my enthusiasm, but I think he could be the future.

2. All the people freaking out about playcalling, how Tim Kelly should be fired immediately, fire Vrabel, etc etc...I was frustrated with some of the playcalling too, especially late in the game. HOWEVER - we had moldy string cheese in place of an o-line, against Cam Heyward, TJ Watt, Highsmith, etc. The fact that we had ANY offensive success in that game was impressive to me. Obviously I wanted us to free Levis, spread the field more, etc, but it's not like the coaches were working with a full toolbox last night. Short week, horrendous o-line (with like 5 more injuries in the game), and we at least had a chance to win at the very end. The coaches weren't perfect, but I'm not trying to fire Vrabel and Kelly based on that game, lol.

3. Going along with point number 2 - in general, we already knew our roster would struggle this year. We're trying to see what we have, do our best to compete, and make it to next year with (hopefully) a young franchise QB, and about $10000000000000 in cap space. But for this season, we really need to chill out on the expectations - we're very talent-poor in a lot of spots (LBs, CBs, O-line, etc).

I get we picked up a couple vets on O-line (and Dhop has been good especially these last few games), but it seems like we should at least be better in at least ONE of those categories. 

I heard Ran and Vrabes on draft day saying they would just take the best available. Is that supposed to work out more in the long term? Should we expect to fix at least one position next year (looking at you O-line) or do we think it will be similar and our weak points will still be weak points again?

Our coaching staff is the only thing holding this up. The fact that everyone was starting to wrap their minds around tanking the rest of the season 8 days ago but all of a sudden assumed we should win tonight shows that this team is still capable even with holes on every single phase of the ball.

552,17mn4ic,"Guys we aren't firing Vrabel, drop it.","It is delusional to think we are firing a coach most of the the league outside of our dipshit fanbase thinks is good. The truth is he's coaching a bad team, that's right I said it.

We are a bad team because we are talent deprived with many of our starters being UDFA's they said as much at the start of this game. We are missing about 3x 1 round picks on this team and several 2nd and 3rd round pick level talent that should be filling out those roles... but the best we have is UDFA's because Jrob absolutely fucked this team with horribly risky picks that we are now paying a talent deficit on.

Its very easy to blame coaches (I myself blame Tim Kelly for tonight for the cowardly play calling in the 4th) but we must also remember we are still the same talent starved team we were when we started the season... a season where we hoped our DL would pull us through games because our offense was so anemic. It is clear now, they simply aren't good enough to win games on their own and even though I again blame Kelly for this loss he's essentially calling up plays one handed... our line barely holds an edge, our WR's are mediocre outside of DHop, TE's are basically no shows... we are limited by our talent and that forces very 1 dimensional low risk play calls like screens plays (which do work but obviously lose their effectiveness if we are running it every fresh set of downs because we don't have anything better).

Next season will be better... we have a shit ton of cap to pull in talent in FA... Ran's picks this year leave a lot of hope that we have a similar draft to fill out some of these holes on our roster with young talent.  Also on a positive note Levis seems to be elevating our receivers beyond what they have performed in the last 2 seasons... and that bodes well when we have ACTUAL talent worth a damn (not named Dhop).",RyokoKnight,2023-11-03 04:39:05,"[('team performance', 0.06), ('coaching and management', -0.35), ('media coverage', 0.12)]"

What was fucking horrible however was the play calling and it’s been a problem the whole season. We simply play scared “play not to lose” football which of course leads to losing. The amount of 3rd down give up plays we do is outrageous. Tonight the egregious one being at the end of the first half. We don’t get in the end zone because they don’t try to. And then the whole second half was a mess, ask madden would’ve given you a more dynamic offense. Idk if it’s Kelly Vrabel both but it’s going to ruin this team regardless of the talent we have and hopefully get next season. We are not up 28 points the games basically tied and they’re calling plays like they’re majorly up, it’s ridiculous.

I noticed it on his run in the second half. If you watch the sideline, you can see that Levis is getting some intense coaching during that play. My guess is the reason Levis hasn't played much thus far is that he's still growing into the playbook, and it seems like they're using Malik to give themselves a minute to explain to Levis what they're seeing on the drive and how he needs to react. That will probably decrease as Levis gets a better command of the offense, but it seems like a good use of both guys. (I like Malik as a person so I hope he can develop into a career backup for someone, even if it's not us, but having two cheap QBs would be really good for us the next two years.)

646,17klkmt,Perspectives for Thursday Night,"I was a Levis supporter and Kentucky fan, but I did not think he was worth a top draft pick and was really a mid to late first round talent. Obviously like all of us, I was pleasantly SHOCKED and in complete awe at his performance against the falcons. It blew my expectations of him completely out of the water. 

Now the more starts he gets, the more data we see on what he is and can be for this franchise going forward. I also am realistic, and highly doubt he will throw four touchdowns every game lol. But he didn’t face an elite pass rush against the falcons, and the offensive line did a good job of blocking them up for him. 

Maybe I’m a shell shocked titans fan but I’m almost expecting a massive downswing against this Steelers pass rush. If he even looks competent and doesn’t throw the game away by himself, I’d be happy with considering him our franchise guy. I’ve seen him in plenty of games where his line is outmatched at Kentucky and it didn’t look pretty. I am afraid of things looking closer to that version of Levis, and we end up having more questions than answers about our rookie QB. 

What do you all think could be a realistic expectation for him? Personally, If he has less than 2 turnovers, I’ll feel a lot better about him being the future. This is a very opportunistic Steelers D that forces a lot of turnovers, but also gives up tons of yards on the ground and through the air.",Wildabeast135,2023-10-31 13:53:39,"[('team performance', 0.05), ('coaching and management', 0.09)]"

I honestly think that there are few defenses that this offense couldn’t play well against if we continue to play like how we did against the Falcons.",DickThunders,2023-10-31 02:46:19,"[('team performance', 0.29), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.05), ('coaching and management', -0.05)]"

670,17k4ul5,Mariota 2016 first start compared to yesterday,"For those interested, I dug up the '16 mariota / winston game highlights because I couldn't really remember anything from that game outside of the long kendall wright TD.

Link here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTYpZUViUc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTYpZUViUc4)

In order, the TD's...

1 - Kendall Wright, RPO from gun shortly on the titans side of the 50 (think bucs 48 or so). ball travels about 20 air yards (11 past LOS) before wright runs another 40 ish for the TD.

2 - Naked boot from under center from the TB 12. Sankey lines up off center in the backfield and slips out for a 2 yard reception that he takes to the house from there.

3 - 4 yard td to harry douglas (not shown in highlight video)

4 - from the bucs 2, under center, straight drop back and hits delanie (split out right in the slot) on a slant that curls to a stop in a hole in the bucs zone about 2 yards into the end zone

net net - idk what levis is gonna be, and its VERY titans for levis to tie mariota with this stat, but rest assured that when you're looking at the throws the two guys made on their way to 4 td first career starts...they are very, very different.

You know how many times I heard how ""dope"", ""awesome"", ""sick"", etc etc. those throwbacks were yesterday? Too many to count. 

I just feel our dark/navy blue jerseys and helmets are boring. I think the sword on the shoulder pads are a little gimmicky too. I also think the flame logo feels dated. Not living in Tennessee, I don't have much of a sense of what others feel about this topic. I understand others may love it and that it's a big part of the community.

I pull for you guys, Detroit, Baltimore and Carolina.  I'm really proud of you all and wish you guys nothing but luck, you deserve to win again.

Can I add that I absolutely despise Dallas, SF, and Pittsburgh?  Also realy used to hate NE but that's bc they won all the fuqin time.  Now I just appreciate Tom's longevity and the fact he did it with multiple teams.

790,17inmdd,Why is there little to no optimism that Levis can come in and make the team better?,"Based on the posts and comments over the past week it seems like the majority of people are checked out on this year.  2-4 has been a disappointing  start but its not like we have to win out to get to the playoffs. This team has always been streaky and we are only 3 wins away from having a winning record just past the half way mark for the season.

The team has a ton of room for improvement.  The offensive line was expected to be pretty bad up to this point in the year, but they were also expecting to get better as the year goes on.  NPF should get better at LT every week and if he can become an above average starter there, that alone drastically improves the team.  I expect the OL to end up with   NPF-Skoronski-Brewer-Dillard-Hubbard.  With some more experience and developed chemistry I think they could stop being our achilles heel. 

I know everyone wants to trade Henry for some mid level talent teenager, but I think over the next couple months he is going to remind everyone just how dominant he can be.  He's never had a dominant first half of the season, even the year he got hurt the only reason he had so much production was because of his usage.  I think the plan has always been to limit his usage early and ramp it up as the year goes on, and it wont surprise me at all if he breaks the Titans franchise record for rushing yards before the year is over.  

As far as the other skill players go,  Hopkins has pretty much been as advertised.  He's made plays when we needed them and will be there when we need him.  We finally have a change of pace back that you don't have to be disappointed to see come on the field.  Moore and NWI are solid and if Burks and Chig can start making some plays we should be able to start sustaining drives.  

Its a lot of moving pieces but it does seem realistic that this offense can become pretty good, especially if Levis comes in and plays better than expected.  If the offense averages 25+ pts/gm the next 3 weeks and gets us to 5-4 the same people posting about tanking will be posting the power rankings talking about the Titans get no respect.  

Last time we started 2-4 and made a QB change we made a run to the AFC Championship.  A lot of poeple will say that team was better and blah blah, but reality is that in real time people were shitting on that team and writing them off too.  If you want to root for this team to lose games because thats what you think they need to get better, your welcome to, but I hope I'm not the only one out here thinking this team will figure it out and has what it takes to compete and thinks they could win right now.

794,17ilc7i,Why do the Titans get so much shit for the AJ Brown trade and the Vikings get none for Stefon Diggs,"I understand they hit on the Jefferson pick and even if Burks pans out he will never be on Jefferson's level, but I don't think that should be factored in when talking about the trade even though it inevitably will.

Trade comparison:

Minnesota receives: 2020 1st(22nd overall), 5th, 6th. 2021 4th

Buffalo receives: Stefon Diggs

Tennessee receives: 18th overall and 101st overall picks

Eagles receive: AJ Brown 

AJ Brown 2022 stats: 1496 yards, 88 receptions,
11 TDs

Previous career highs: 1075 yards, 70 receptions, 11 TDs

Stefon Diggs 2020 stats: 1535 yards, 127 receptions, 8 TDs

Previous career highs: 1130 yards, 102 receptions, 9 TDs

Both players left for better situations and had better production. Both teams received similar compensation. The only difference is the Vikings hit on the pick and we didn't. Also diggs was 27 his first year in Buffalo and AJ was 25 his first year in Philly.",ilovezeldasfeet,2023-10-28 19:40:19,"[('team performance', -0.28), ('coaching and management', -0.07), ('media coverage', -0.1), ('stadium amenities', 0.04), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.06), ('miscellaneous', -0.12)]"

798,17ijiz3,Dumb Titan's Conspiracy Theory,"I have this conspiracy theory that I don't actually think is true, but for entertainment purposes, it's fun the think about. My theory is this, Tannehill is not actually very injured, and all this crazy QB talk from Vrabel is actually a smokescreen, but not for this game against the Falcons. What he's actually trying to do is maintain trade value for Tannehill and Willis.

Hear me out. Tannehill didn't come out of the game immediately when he got hurt, it was after his interception that he got pulled from the game. I think that Vrabel had enough and decided right then that he needed to play the young guys and try to get something for trading Tannehill, but he couldn't just come out and say that he was benching Tanny because that would tank any value he might have so he played up the injury to give him a reason why Tannehill isn't suiting up for this game. But he's also continuing to talk Tannehill up, saying ""he's the starter when healthy"" and ""he might be able to play this week"" to show that Tanny is still good enough to be a starter and also to show that the injury isn't too serious and won't keep him out longer than maybe a couple of weeks. Essentially, trying to convince other teams that he's still starter caliber and won't be out too long so if they are in need of a starting QB, Tannehill is worth going after.

For Willis, he's saying that there's no clear winner for the starting gig between him and Levis, so when Levis goes out there and looks good, the team can try to convince other teams that Willis is on the same level, if maybe still in need of some development. So if another team thinks they can develop him, the Titans can trade him for something rather than cut him for nothing. Again, if Vrabel came out and immediately said that Levis is the starter because Willis sucks, it tanks any potential value he might have to another team. 

Again, I want to be clear that I think there's only about a 2% chance that any of this is even remotely true, but it was fun to think about.

I don't know how Levis will perform against the Falcons defense and against the rest of the schedule, but ideally you should stick with your young guy throughout the rest of the season. Ryan has clearly lost a step and isn't in his prime anymore, to also add on with his stats being the worst they've ever been. Levis might struggle at times and be good as well, but I don't see a reason to give the job back to Tannehill. It's about looking towards the future with Levis, letting Ryan taking the job back means it's about giving him at least a decent send off to Vrabel I imagine.",Officer_Zack,2023-10-28 17:24:59,"[('team performance', -0.1), ('coaching and management', 0.16)]"

Yes, the Tennessee Titans were once the Houston Oilers under the same ownership. However, the Oilers did move to Tennessee and lost many Houston fans in doing so.

The city of Houston is what experienced and loved the Houston Oilers, not the City of Nashville. Houston experience decades rooting for their home team, the Oilers. 

We as Titans fans, love the Tennessee Titans, that’s the team Tennessee has always had. Except for like 1 year where we were the TENNESSEE Oilers. 

Tennessee never had Earl Campbell, Tennessee never had Warren Moon. The city of Houston did and that’s who showed those players love, not Tennessee. 

Of course yes it’s all about money and the Titans would be stupid to not wear Oilers merch cus Oilers merch is better. However you’d be upset if the Titans moved to Virginia and called themselves the “Virginia Tigers” and occasionally wore Titans merch, meanwhile Tennessee has a new Team called the “Tennessee Blues” and the Tennessee Blues never get to wear Titans gear… 

Y’all get upset over not converting a 3rd down in the 2nd Quarter of a damn September game… ya think you’d keep your shit together in this scenario?

I’m a fan of the Titans cus my dad who watched the Oilers followed the team from Houston to Tennessee.

822,17hva8j,Why does losing Byard mean the season is over?,"I love KB—one of my top 5 favorite Titans of all time. Also I understand the optics of trading a great player near the deadline definitely looks like we're tanking.

But my question is: does losing Byard actually move the needle that much with respect to whether or not we win or lose games? Obviously difficult to determine the impact of his absence until we watch the upcoming games, but I'm curious why it seems like the majority of fans and media are acting like losing a single player will automatically tank the rest of our season?

Personally my hunch would be that Ran is playing a bit of moneyball and has analytics that suggest replacing a top safety with an okay safety won't have that much of an impact on the current season, and will give us resources for next season. That said, KB was obviously more than just a top safety—he was directing the defense and helping call out plays and coverages, etc.

Probably copium because I don't want to believe in the tank, but I'm curious if anyone else has similar thoughts.",VelvetBlue,2023-10-27 19:23:24,"[('team performance', -0.05), ('team performance', -0.02), ('coaching and management', 0.18), ('team performance', -0.03), ('team performance', -0.05), ('coaching and management', 0.13), ('team performance', 0.1), ('coaching and management', 0.2), ('team performance', -0.33), ('team performance', -0.19), ('team performance', 0.07), ('team performance', -0.02), ('team performance', -0.22), ('team performance', -0.41), ('team performance', -0.1), ('team performance', -0.26), ('coaching and management', 0.06), ('team performance', 0.08), ('team performance', -0.08), ('team performance', -0.22), ('team performance', -0.22)]"

First half time outs shouldn't be saved as much as they are. 

Our offense cannot waste timeouts. It's just not excusable. It rarely seems we try to run a super quick 2 min offense at the end of half (even when there's like 30 seconds left and 2 TOs, we just take a knee into half).

If I had to make some observations, I don't think generating comparable yardage/TD numbers is going to be the hardest part for the boy. Sacks and turnovers are going to be key given his college tape and I suspect he has the potential to blow past these figures in his first few games. In view of his lightning-fast release and Oscar-worthy play fakes, it would be great to see Tim Kelly leaning into the run and quick-game to help him adjust early on.

902,17f518x,Tank Commander’s Guide to Week 8,"Alright, there’s a lot that went wrong this season. We lost to the Colts for the first time since the last presidential administration, Tannehill’s regressed hard, the offensive line’s fallen off a cliff, and Kevin Byard is no longer a Titan. With all that in mind, there are some people looking to give up on this season and looking to the spring. Putting aside the comparisons to 2019, a year from where we only have four starters remaining, here is a guide to what we need to to do to boost draft positioning.

Titans vs **Falcons**: Given. This team is only one game removed from Cincinnati, a team that holds the 18th overall pick. Every loss helps. If Levis looks like he can become something, all the better.

**Patriots** at Dolphins: By SOS, the Pats have it tougher than us with similar offensive line issues. We likely have to get ahead of them for our guy. Don’t bet on Miami to falter against a depleted New England defense, though.

Vikings at **Packers**: The former already passed behind us with their win over San Fran. Green Bay could be moving on from David Bahktiari, so they need as many wins as possible to keep them away from Alt or Fashanu.

Jets at **Giants**: This team is the new poster child for shit offensive line play. Another contender for Alt or Fashanu needing to be pushed aside. By SOS similar to New England, we’ll need them to have more wins outright.

Texans at **Panthers**: Currently, the team holds the 1st overall pick, and it’s unlikely we’ll be that bad, but any assistance is always welcome. The Bears are looking for their own ways to build the offense and trenches, so there’s competition there. 

Bengals at **49ers**: A weaker SOS always helps with these.

Chiefs at **Broncos**: Give Denver another win, and they’ll be behind us in draft order. Don’t bet on KC losing this game, though.

Bears at **Chargers**: LA’s looking for defensive help, so they’re competition for Kool-Aid or a potential trade up option ahead of us. 

If all goes according to plan, the Titans will hold the 4th overall pick. If that holds, we get pretty much anyone we want that’s not named Williams, Maye or Harrison.",YiMyonSin,2023-10-24 05:05:03,"[('team performance', -0.16), ('coaching and management', 0.13), ('pricing', -0.05), ('media coverage', -0.05), ('miscellaneous', -0.08)]"

As far as the trade goes we did receive a 5th and a 6th round pick for next years draft which is great. We need to get younger and more talented in multiple positions. Looks like Ran is gathering assets to trade up in next years draft or to fill the needs we have across our entire football team. The writing was definitely on the wall as we asked him to take a pay cut in the off-season and this is the last year of his contract.

923,17etu2n,Kevin Byard wasn't going to play for the Titans in 2024. This was a good trade.,"Byard has what is essentially a team option in 2024. He can be cut with 0 dead cap. The team asked him to take a paycut this season. HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE IN A TITANS JERSEY NEXT SEASON. This is a good deal for all parties. Titans get some value for a player they weren't going to keep, Eagles get what is likely a 1 year rental for a pro-bowl safety, Titans do right by KB and send him to a contender.

This is not a ""LOL Titans GM sucks"" move. This is not a ""trade a generational WR before his prime for a 1st round pick"" move. This is a proactive (and analytical) move for a team who will now commit to focusing on the future. If Ran and Vrabes can get a 3rd for Henry who is on an expiring contract and also will not be here next year, that would be a homerun. Add in a Hop trade, Autry trade, Fulton trade if they can.

It's time to tank fellas.

936,17ekzwv,Can the mods make a final “fuck J rob thread” for the AJ brown trade and we try to be done with it?,"That was a historically bad trade. It set us back an amount that it is hard to quantify. It’s embarrassing that the FO was dumb enough to pay old man tannehill instead of a near-generational WR (he may end up being generational). And AJ was just a great dude that loved the titans (until they soured it)… he literally cried when his starting QB got benched then went on to ball out with the next guy for a few years then asked for a fair contract. Sure he got a little dramatic iirc, but he was an elite franchise cornerstone that wanted to be here and deserved top WR money because that’s what he was

That said… it happened. Nothin is gonna change that. Burks appears to be mid, but guys with less talent have had slower starts than him and gone on to have good careers. There’s no real value of being annoyed when Aj does big things. He’s a good dude that deserves it, and the idiot that literally gave him away and paid the shipping is gone. Let’s see what these new guys do and stop dwelling on what could’ve been. It sucks but getting mad at the past is a terrible way to spend time as a fan 

Honestly 3 picks vs the bengals felt like a turning point for the franchise and that annoys me more than the Aj trade because it was so easy to prevent, and has had a massive snowball effect since. But fuck it. Let’s hope that mayo man can lead us back to relevance with his quick release and madden create-a-player QB build.

Robert Kraft obviously loves Vrabel and there has been rumblings that he would not hesitate to let go of Belichick if things don't turn around. Let's say hypothetically it happens. Let's say Robert Kraft wants Vrabel to be the new head coach of the Patriots, since it seems to be he has been the only successful disciple so far as a head coach under Belichicks tutelage. 

Should we take it? Saints just received a 1st round and 2nd round pick for Payton. If Ran wants to rebuild this team in his vision and wants the draft capitol, do you think this should be something to even fathom?

1. Tannehill is in the last year of his deal. He's going to ride off into the sunset. Vrabel respects everything Tannehill has done and he's not going to screw him over. Vrabel knows what it's like to be an NFL player. He treats players like people, not numbers. That's why the team respects him. He's loyal. That goes a long way in free agency and with culture. 

2. Vrabel isn't going to ruin Levis by putting him out there when he's clearly not ready behind a bad o-line. He's going to ride the bench and learn what it is to be an NFL QB by watching. Levis going in a game is the absolute last resort and goes against the plan the team has for him. 

3. The Titans don't care what we think. Us fans are slaves to instant gratification. We want it all right now. That's not how things work. They have a plan and they'll stick to it until they can't anymore. Hit the draft and free agency to fill holes in Ran's second year and give Levis a better team than we have now. That's the plan. 

You might not like it but I guarantee that's the thinking bc that's what good organizations do. We all knew we weren't winning a Super Bowl this year so what's the rush?

1014,179wox9,Expectations from Levis?,"Morning all

As we have precious little positive to discuss heading into our bye week beyond the prospect of Levis showing what he's made of, I was keen to get a sense of what we feel he could end up producing for us.

With the other three rookie QBs also sitting on teams with dubious O Lines and limited weaponry, I think it would be informative to look at what they've been able to produce as a benchmark.

On a per-game basis:

CJ Stroud 59.6% completions, 276 yards, 1.5 TDs, 0.16 INTs, 2.2 Sacks

Bryce Young 63.2% completions, 193 yards, 1.2 TDs, 0.66 INTs, 3.2 Sack

Anthony Richardson 59.5% completions, 144 yards, 0.75 TDs, 0.25 INTs, 1.75 Sacks 

For context, Tannehill has managed 62% completions, 188 yards, 0.3 TDs, 1 INT, 3.16 Sacks.

Whilst we're obviously a run heavy offence, it's worth noting that even last season Tannehill was averaging more than 1TD per game, throwing to the ghost of Robert Woods and the broken remains of Treylon Burks.

It's also striking to see Tannehill throwing INTs at a faster rate than any of the rookies, and at double the rate he was turning the ball over last season.

It would be easy to point at the offensive line, but our QB pressures allowed rate is way down on last year, and isn't even in the 10 worst in the league.

Ryan is generating fewer rushing yards per game than even last season, when he played a stretch of games with an injured ankle. Whether it's age or injury, I think he's lost a step in mobility, which is making him a sack magnet and reducing his output - even factoring in his re-tooled protection.

Whilst football is played on turf, not spreadsheets, I genuinely think we coul expect to see improvement on offence *IF* Levis can generate the same sort of numbers as the other rookies. Even if he could hit the output of Anthony ""can't finish a game"" Richardson in a run heavy Colts offence, we would more than double our number of passing touchdowns.

Let’s be honest, none of it matters. We are in a rebuilding year, and there is no reason to pretend otherwise. We aren’t “one piece away” from being a contender. 


We are like 11-13 pieces away, not including depth. We need: QB, LT, RG, RT, WR1 (Burks is MiA), WR 3/4, TE1 (Chig can’t block), OLB2 (Landry is mid so far btw), ILB 1 and 2, and better corners at both outside positions and the slot (CB1, CB2, CB3).

Sure, throw Levis out there behind that putrid line and get him hurt just like Tannehill has been the last two years. It won’t mean shit.

I'd also be 100% OK if we finish the season deep in the double-digit losses - I don't think the current roster (even with all players healthy) is going to make the playoffs.

... regardless of draft position or round. I know we don't have a ton of draft picks next year, but I thought this would be an interesting thought experiment nonetheless.

That being said, I'd love to see us select Olu Fashanu (Penn State) for left-tackle next year. Dude is a straight up mauler and I think he'd help solidify the left-side of our O-Line alongside Skoronski for years to come. Then we could try sliding NPF back over to RT (assuming we don't bring Hubbard back).

I would love to see him used in the same way the Saints use Taysom Hill. 

I would think, given what we traded to go up and get him just outside of the first round that we would use this opportunity to find out what he brings to the table.

1043,178zh0y,Possibly going to my first ever Titans game and looking for advice.,"
Looking to go to my first Titans game ever and after discussing it with friends and family were looking to drive up there for the Dec 24 game.  Few questions about the game.

1) what's the weather like? 

2)Where's best seats if it's raining or snowing? 

3)one of my friends was interested in seats where we get served. Is there a section like this? 

4)Best site to buy tickets from or should I buy local. Would be about 7 of us. 

5) is there a tailgate party before kickoff? 

Those are my basic questions for football, now a few about while I'm there if that's cool. We plan to come for the whole Weekend. None of us have ever been to Nashville. 

6) we're looking at grand ole opry on the Friday for the concert. Are prices usually 300 dollars a seat? Or is there a better place to find tickets?

7) what are your must dos while we are there. 

Thank you for your help

1054,178r4tm,First Time Watching Titans In-Person & First Ever NFL Game,"UK fan here, managed to get tickets to see the game at Spurs today and wanted to just decompress my thoughts and experience here.
  
 
 GOOD BITS
- My first ever stadium experience was amazing, the seats and view were perfect and I got to see all my favourite players in the flesh.
- We arrived about 2 hours early and got to see the Titans get off the bus.
- I got a photo with T-Rac and the cheerleaders outside the stadium.
- 99% of the fan interactions I had were great, it felt like there were more Ravens fans than Titans fans, at least in the area we were sat.
  
  
 
NOT SO GOOD BITS
- When getting the photo with T-Rac and the girls I put my arms around them as they were for me and got told by an overzealous security guy ""Stop touching the cheerleaders"" not a big deal but nobody told me beforehand and he was the only one to say something.
- There were 2 Ravens fans Infront of us who spent the entire game slating the Titans. ""There's no team I hate more than the Titans"", "" Nick Folk is a fat >! cunt !< "", When the Ravens player got ejected they spent the next 15 minutes rewatching the highlight on Twitter and shouting how there was nothing wrong with the hit and their helmets didn't even collide. They even boo'd the cheerleaders whenever they did a routine. Don't get me wrong we were cheering the PI calls and penalty flags that went in our advantage but to openly slate players and cheerleading members takes a special sort of person I think. 

 

 
Overall the game and experience was an extremely positive one, even though it wasn't a win I still enjoyed myself so much.

1087,177zzog,'Twas the night before Stuntmas,"

Twas the night before Stuntmas, and all through the London underground, not a creature was stirring, not even them hoes.

A football game thrilling, on this special day.
The helmets were hung in the locker room with care,
In hopes that a victory soon would be theirs.

The players were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of touchdowns danced in their heads.
And Vrabel in his headset, and Tannehill his cap,
Had just settled down for another 3rd and long snap.

When out on the field there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my seat to see what was the matter.

King Henry had just reduced a raven to a splatter.

With a strong quarterback, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment, it must be a Tannethrill trick.
He shouted, and threw, and called them by name!

""Now Henry, now Hop, now Kinsey and Spears,
On Moore, on NWI, let's win on this Sunday!
To the top of the league, to the end zone so tall,
Now dash away, dash away, Titans give it your all!""

So up to the concrete field the players they flew,
With the game full of hope, and their spirits renewed.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the field,
The cheering and roars from the fans would not yield.
As I drew in my head and was turning around,
Down the field, the Titans advanced, gaining ground.

They were dressed all in navy, from their heads to their toes,
With a logo of Titans, and a sword that rose.
A bundle of touchdowns they had flung on their back,
And they looked like true champions, with no lack.

Their eyes—how they twinkled! Tannehill's passes so precise!
Their tackles so strong, like an impenetrable vice!
Their droll little mouths were drawn up in a smile,
As they scored once again, making it all worthwhile.

The Titans were relentless, they played with such might,
And they carried the day into the London night.
But I heard them exclaim as they ran out of sight,
""Titan up in London, and to all a good night!""",Toastfrom2069,2023-10-14 21:48:50,"[('team performance', 0.53), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.31), ('miscellaneous', 0.07)]"

In my opinion I expect Tim Kelly to reach in the bag of tricks often to win.

AJ Brown is gone. Derrick Henry is on his way out. The defense is falling apart. And Tannehill is not the future.

1141,162dnoo,The truth about the QB2 battle.,"I know this won’t be popular but the truth is by Vrabel not naming a backup, he’s essentially naming Levis the backup. 

Malik had a very uphill battle to win this job because there was a change at GM, and Ran and Vrabel got together and said there needs to be a change at QB2 and Vrabel had probably made his mind up about Malik after last year. So Malik had to be incredible this preseason to earn all the backup reps again this season. What we saw was a lot of improvement but also a lot of more of the same, ups and downs, game management errors, many fumbles, more INTs than TD passes, 128 yards passing per game against mostly 2nd and 3rd stringers. 

I do believe Malik has improved in almost every area but it’s not enough to be a reliable backup or for them to change course on their initial plans.

1160,10evx4m,SF qb situation just got interesting,"Look, I'm a Tanney truther. He is the qb I want under center for atleast 2023.

But, if we look behind the curtain a little, SF has to move one of their qbs. And they'll surely be compensated. But if we can move and get a guy on a rookie deal (Lance, Purdy) OR a cheap Jimmy G (admittedly I do not want Jimmy G), there's some big potential cap space considerations there. And now we have a man on the inside.

No matter what, I don't see any QB on the roster next year being our potential long term fix (unless Malik gets like 10 years better in this off-season somehow) but it's an interesting thought after hiring Ran as GM. If the price is right it's gotta be a consideration. Just don't get robbed on the trade compensation.

Amy has shown in the firings of mike Mularky  and JRob that she is quick to pull the trigger when she loses confidence in her leadership, and that she listens to the complaints of fans. I have a nasty feeling this is the beginning of another Dark Age in titans history, where we clean house, get rid of our top talent and start from scratch. I think this is unwise but I can’t shake the feeling that Vrabel will either be fired or accept a college job to get out of this mess. I think the entire history of the franchise was altered this year when Vrabel went on the Rich Eisen show and said as long as he was HC, AJ would be on this team. When Jrob traded him it made a liar out of vrabel and broke our team from the top down, and closed our Super Bowl window in the Derrick Henry era. Instead of going full rebuild we extend Henry for years past his prime and doubled down on a problematic offensive philosophy.

But he also had a very great supporting cast. Say what you will about Corey Davis and Jonnu Smith but they were key players who signed big contracts when they left.

Now that he dosnt have a top 3 group of offensive players and a great coordinator who turned HC, he is back to what he looked like in Miami. A sub par QB

Vrabal even stated the fact that he has to have alot around him to be successful. But when your paying him all that money and signing all your stars on offense and defense. The money to bring in high quality guys through FA is gonna be thin. And the previous drafts have not done this offense any favors for the future.

I still like Tannehill and while I think he is the 16th best QB. I think that's still good enough to take us back to the playoffs next year, as I believe we have a top 5 overall roster.

1195,t37944,Titans Offseason Simulation & Mock Draft,"**Co-GMs/staff:** Titanfanintexas, Yard, Gurnels

**Introduction:** I was invited to be the Titans GM in a full offseason simulation. This includes coaching staffs, free agency, retirements, re-signings, restructures, tags, tenders, draft picks, trades, UDFAs, salary cap, contracts, & a ton of part-time work. Keep in mind, everything I type below is a live community simulation for fictional fun. There are real persons conducting this event. Just know, it is not connected to reality. If you do not like the simulation that has been performed below. Then keep in mind, it’s just a movie or fictional novel & not real.  

This process has 100+ total members that try to achieve this live community simulation of what all NFL teams will do in the many weeks ahead. I’m competing against 31 other GMs just as Jon Robinson is. There are about a dozen commissioners that act as moderators & as 3rd party agents to determine where free agents might lean with their decisions. This event began a month ago.

The simulation has rules just as the NFL has rules that all GMs & executives have to abide by. Each team has to field 70 total players before they can draft. Then have 90 total players at the end. I can send in bids & offers to players that I want to re-sign first. Then, I send in bids to external free agents I bid on. This is not like Madden where you can bring in any & every free agent that you want. You have to not just outbid the competition, you have to give respectable & possibly overpaid offers or the agent might decline your offer. The commissioners have a big role just like sport agents in reality that can tip the scales of whom is accepted & whom is not accepted for such club. Once an offer is submitted, there is no point of return & cannot cancel the offer.  

As of today, the TEN cap is at negative -8.3 million give or take. I had to make tough decisions for the sake of the franchise. 

**Coaching:** 1st order of staff business was firing inept OC Todd Downing. I wanted either two new OCs for TEN 1) Joe Brady 2) Greg Roman 3) Tim Kelly. I gave pitches to both coaches, it did no good in the end. DEN & MIN quickly took both Joe & Greg. So I got Tim Kelly in simulation just as reality. The Titans front office tried to advertise Tim will be the passing game coordinator. I think it’s mere misdirection or deception by Mike Vrabel. 2nd order of staff business was hiring Kerry Coombs as a DB assistant coach. After hearing Kerry & Ohio State Buckeyes went separate ways, I jumped to return Kerry to our staff. In reality, Kerry became the DB coach for Cincinnati Bearcats. 3rd order of staff business was demoting Shane Bowen as assistant coach & promoting the real DC behind the scenes in Jim Schwartz. To be honest, I think Bowen & Downing are fronts or pawns.

**Pro Scouting:** Before I re-signed any Titans next, I went through the entire realm of all pro free agents. Making my own board at each position. Checking which of my favorites free agents actually played 13-17 games to ensure their durability for the future of their careers. Knowing is half the battle. As it helps in a big way when it comes to offers of how much to bid on a player if they’re healthy or they’re not. As the term goes: caveat emptor.

**Retirements:** CB Jackrabbit/Janoris Jenkins was the only Titan that retired for unknown reasons. This is decided by the commissioners. I was going to release Jenkins all the same, if JJ did not make this decision, for me, as is a cap casualty.  

Then is when the good stuff happens. When it gets real!

**TRADES:**  

>1) The Washington Commanders is trading pick 42 to the Tennessee Titans for QB Ryan Tannehill     
>  
>2)  The Tennessee Titans are trading pick 167 to the New York Jets for WR Denzel Mims

The last 2 Titans playoff games left a bad taste in my mouth. Specifically watching WR AJ Brown always open & is not thrown the ball. This occurred in the Bengals loss in 2021 & the Ravens loss in 2020. 

Yes, I traded away a starting QB away that caused 3 INTs in the finale, when the defense got 9 sacks. I gained a 2nd round pick that was lost due to gaining Julio Jones. I did gain about 12 million in cap space by trading away Ryan. Yet, when the accounting sheet factors in the dead money left behind on Ryan’s contract. The trade did hurt a little bit with 28 million in dead money. Which means this move may not occur in reality. Yet it could occur beyond June 1st. As Ryan’s dead money falls to only 9 million if traded after June 1st.

I believe in Denzel Mims & like the athletic talent as the Titans WR3. Our war room thinks the Jets did not utilize the full potential of what Mims can be with only 44 targets in 2021. Some want to claim Denzel had issues learning the Jets playbook. I think that is a Jets excuse. Mims replacing NWI as our WR3 is addition by subtraction at it’s finest. Technically, David Quessenberry is an UFA, yet the commissioners allowed us to tender & trade David, pulling a JRobbery there, for an additional 7th round draft pick.

**Tagging:** I franchise tagged OLB Harold Landry for a 17.4 million cap hit as a LB.  Landry is an outside linebacker & is not a DE. Do not let anyone fool you on that topic either. See extensions below for more on this subject.

**Tenders:** I tendered OLB Derick Roberson with a 2nd round tender & tendered DT Teair Tart for as an ERFA. I did not mind overpaying for either as wanted to ensure both returned for us. 

**Restructuring:** This is something that TEN strongly needs to do as can gain 40+ million in cap space if restructure 6 players. I fully understand not all players will agree to take a restructure. Most will, as they’re getting their $ up front & sooner. I restructured contracts of Bud Dupree, Kevin Byard, Taylor Lewan, Julio Jones, Derrick Henry, & Denico Autry.  

**1st Cuts:** LB Joseph Jones, QB Kevin Hogan, TE Austin Fort, OL Derwin Gray, OL Jodan Roos. I also had to manually cut Jeremey McNichols & Nick Westbrook off the sheet, even though both the RB & WR are UFAs. It is almost as if these two names are stuck like glue. No other teams want them & their contracts are always so cheap, TEN continues to keep them at bay. I do not. Turn the page!  

**Re-signings:** I was able to re-sign C Ben Jones, OLB Ola Adeniyi, RB D’Onta Foreman, CB Buster Skrine, safety Dane Cruikshank, & LS Morgan Cox

**Extension:** Yes, I know many want AJ Brown & Jeffery Simmons locked up for many-many years. I will allow JRob the man himself to handle those hefty two contracts between July to next March. As they say, out of my pay grade. The commissioners tried to argue with our war room that Harold Landry was a DE & not a OLB. As the DE tag is more expensive than the LB tag (21 vs 17). This debate was futile in the end: 

>Tennessee Titans have reached an extension agreement with Edge Harold Landry for 5 years, $74,378,000

This move reduced Landry’s cap hit from 17.4 million, down to 11 million. We did this same smooth transaction last minute with Derrick Henry. As tagged right before the deadline on March 8th at 3:59pm, then extended on July 15th at 3:59pm.  

**2nd Cuts:** I was saving the big 3 releases within about 48 hours before Signing Day. To try to sneak it in late, so others might not notice ;)

>TEN releases Zach Cunningham, Rodger Saffold, & Kendall Lamm. 

In reality, TEN needs to move on from Saffold & Lamm. Saffold is 34 years old & got injured late. These three releases can help the cap space in a big way

**External free agency.:** This is not the fun part. As remember that pro scouting board I did weeks ago. Well each day with tags & re-signings from other teams, it gets slowly reduced. Like someone taking a knife & cutting an entire layer off the top continuously & slowly. Names like JC Jackson, Davante Adams, Chris Godwin, Zach Ertz, Laken Tomlinson, James Daniels, Brandon Scherff, Orlando Brown, Joseph Noteboom, Charvarius Ward, Kyzir White, Haason Reddick, Marcus Williams, Matt Gay, Younghoe Too, & Mike Gesicki = all gone, are quickly tagged or re-signed “seat’s taken, you cannot sit here.”

We had close to positive 45 million in cap space to try to acquire external assets. I try to put in offers to Christian Kirk, Terron Armstead, DJ Chark, Foysade Oluokun, Folorunso Fatukasi, Marcus Mariota, Bradley Bozeman, Michael Gallup, David Njoku, DeVondre Campbell, Arden Key, & Dalton Schultz. Then every one of those players’ agents demanded more money. Why because other teams kept outbidding me. I kept increasing each of those bids for names above & my offers we’re always outbid. I lost out on all of those names unfortunately. As only the teams willing to pay the most get the best. Keep in mind agents would lie to me always asking for more money to increase the offer. No team can offer every player they want 20+ AAV million per year or they will go quickly broke. The average AAV for any of those names above was 13+ per year.

Here are the names I landed: G Alex Cappa, ILB Zach Cunningham, RB Melvin Gordon III, TE Tyler Conklin, TE Cameron Brate, OLB Ogbonnia Okoronkwo, OLB Dante Fowler Jr, QB Mike White, QB Teddy Bridgewater, QB Phillip Walker, WR Cam Sims, CB Mike Hughes, ILB Oren Burks, DT Derrick Nnadi, & K Dustin Hopkins.

[Titans Depth Chart](https://preview.redd.it/j0c3tzaiihk81.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=811ef5ef625ad709d69de331a00246ff5ecc0426)

The entire draft was a slow draft format that lasted about a week in real time. I do realize 16 draft picks is a ton to list & write about. As TEN only has 7 draft picks as of today. I wanted to trade down to gain as much picks as I could for the franchise. I was unable to land Marcus Mariota in free agency due to the simulation agents not returning my calls on Marcus. So, I took the deal with the Giants to gain their early 2nd & Marcus while giving up our 23' first & Teddy Bridgewater. It's a sacrifice, yet that gave me an advantage. I used that #36 from the Giants as my first pick, while simultaneously trading down with Saints, giving them our #26 & getting out of the first round. All my popular favorites we're gone by #26 in Garrett Wilson, Ikem Ekwonu, Tyler Linderbaum, & Kenyon Green. So I wanted out of the pick.

[Perrion Winfrey](https://preview.redd.it/30j4zkaplhk81.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9743e56ccc453f07db5a81276ba933563503a113)

The man was very high on my big board for round 2. Jordan Davis & Devonte Wyatt we're both gone by this pick. So I went with BPA (best player available) for the first pick as most should. Winfrey was the most dominant prospect in the Senior Bowl practices. Perrion was also so dominant that won the Senior Bowl MVP trophy from the game itself.

Perrion has an explosive first step and quick hands that makes him able to feast on solo blocks in the run game, which allows him to disrupt running backs' lanes. Winfrey has size, power, strong tackler, can anchor, shed, & chase. Perrion provides some secondary interior pass rush, getting most penetration when playing the three-technique. The Sooner consistently wins the battle in the trenches with his always-on-motor. Perrion is very versitile & has played every position along the line. So being able to either place Winfrey at NT or DE if Denico Autry ever needs a rest is huge for the Titans defense being next to Big Jeff. Please do not think that TEN needs a NT as Teair Tart & Naquan Jones have both played admirably well. Perrion is a luxury pick & when one makes a top 50 pick, it needs to be explosive. Autry will be turning 32 this season, so this is a long-term decision for the future. As Autry is not going to be awesome for the Titans forever. 

[Sam Howell](https://preview.redd.it/7zh9ouzqmhk81.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53fd95e48ed61ade5fdb5daed80a2f6a739fa0e5)

Sam Howell was given a 90.9 overall grade. The velocity on his passes in Mobile was better than expected and supported by the data of a 525.6 spin rate that led all quarterbacks on day two of practice. Sam has good athleticism and the ability to move the pocket with his legs, has arm talent for days. He has been an elite deep-ball thrower over course of his career, is light on his feet in the pocket. He can make subtle and not-so-subtle moves to buy time. Has a thick build. Howell shrugs off defenders with relative ease and broke 65 tackles in 2021. Malik Willis was QB1 on my board, yet taken #5 overall by the Bucs. Sam falling this far to #45 overall was a major steal for our war room as is QB2 on my board.

[Isaiah Likely](https://preview.redd.it/jzbbkszymhk81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4165ddc686e549833125dc92d242592e39d06e9d)

Chanticleer is a highly competitive player, quickly gets to the perimeter, blocking well in space & at the second level. Likely is the 2nd best run-blocker in this class at the position. Comes off the snap quick, low, & hard. Runs low & accelerates quickly. A savvy, reliable pass catcher with good body control & focus. Isaiah has soft hands & has the hand-eye coordination to secure wild throws. Was given a 91.1 receiving grade. Trey McBride was TE1 on our board yet Trey fell #43 to the Falcons. The Tight End position is a huge concern & primary need for the Titans this offseason. I feel we accomplished priority #1 with TE2 on my board at #66 overall!

[Calvin Austin III](https://preview.redd.it/6vv0wywnnhk81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2104660dd44fdbfb62d7e88383e0df0a93fc3fc8)

The Blue Tiger is a track star that reached 20.63mph in Mobile. I firmly expect Calvin to be the fastest man at the combine this next week. CA3 had the most explosive receptions of 15-plus yards 28, 85.2 receiving grade, 2.99 yards per route run, & 14 broken tackles on 74 receptions. In Mobile, Austin earned the highest receiving grade among qualifying wide receivers in practice, & generated multiple steps of separation on over half of his targets against single coverage.

**On the WR subject.** I realize & fully understand most TEN fans crave an earlier WR in this draft class. To me, if Garrett Wilson is taken, as was in this simulation mock at pick #19 overall to the Ravens. Then, I rather wait until round 3 for Austin. I brought in Denzel Mims, Cam Sims, & Calvin Austin III as our 3 new WRs to try to get reps & work in behind AJ & Julio. The first pick does not have to be a WR. There are 140+ WRs in this draft class. I patiently waited & allowed the WR to come to us!

[Nik Bonitto](https://preview.redd.it/1tmyqv1tshk81.jpg?width=3200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9d8a4efd710c24729cd77101b565e834b5234f7)

Throughout Nik's career, achieved an amazing 17.9% pressure rate, came away quietly ranking 1st in the FBS in pass-rush grade, pass-rush win rate, & pressure rate generated. Nik was a hybrid LB in 2019. Every Saturday during the football season, I watch tape. When the NCAA & NFL season is over, I continue to watch tape. Because Bonitto was not invited to any all-star games, Nik's stock is falling too much. Nik was not invited because declared early as an redshirt junior. I've been very impressed with Winfrey & Bonitto defensive prowess as Sooners. Adding those two prospects to our front seven is amazing for TEN. To be brief, this pick is Bud insurance. Dupree has a very expensive cap hit & contract for the next 2-3 years. I'm not trying to replace Dupree here. Bud only played 11 games in 2021. This pick is simply some luxury depth at OLB in case Bud is not active any game.

[Matt Araiza](https://preview.redd.it/b1ghghz9ohk81.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=408dfcd81d1ad4fa5aa44cfabe471a317e03c40f)

Leads the FBS in punt average at 51.9 yards and was on pace to break the NCAA FBS record as a punter. Araiza has made 90 of 91 extra points for the Aztecs, if we ever need Matt to make some extra points for us. I fully believe Matt is the best punter in this class & is a perfect replacement for Brett Kern in 2023. Brett has 1 year left on his contract. I do hear good things about Jordan Stout, Jake Carmada, & Ryan Stonehouse too.

[D'Marco Jackson](https://preview.redd.it/z06ij9auohk81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc5a321e16d6294d5d9a77d50ab50868f8dbc947)

Action Jackson is a top 10 LB in this class/on my board. Marco Polo grew up on a farm, enjoys bull riding, calf wrestling, & was state champ in discus. I wanted to return Jayon Brown. The Bears out-bidded us & we lost out on returning Jayon. Being able to return Zach Cunningham & having Jackson replace Jayon is enough for me at ILB. We have to believe in Monty Rice returning to form, as that was Jon's decision to take Monty. David Long is our LB1.

[Thayer Munford](https://preview.redd.it/aihy1hxdphk81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9144c5c2101449e2777cf31cd16d04c2284f99d9)

Munford graded above 85.0 as both a pass-blocker & a run-blocker. The senior has allowed just two total pressures (both hurries) in 5 games. Tayer has the quickness, growth potential, long arms, & powerful base. The Buckeye plays with appropriate wide base, intelligence, instincts, & agility to seal the edge. Aggressive extending with power to punch & looks comfortable in space. 

**OLINE:** I do understand that OL is a glaring need. As everyone on the Titans OL excluding Nate Davis is aging. I re-signed Ben Jones for 2 years. Then, I brought in Alex Cappa to replace Rodger Saffold. I felt Rodger was too injured & being 34 years old, Saffold needed to be outright replaced. When we landed Cappa as our most expensive free agent, that did alter my draft plan as to wait on OL. Thayer can help ease the pain when Taylor Lewan has any setbacks at LT. Dillon Radunz at RT was only allowed one start in 2021. I fully believe in the talent of Radunz as held his own vs SF shutting down Nick Bosa.

[Reed Blankenship](https://preview.redd.it/ojegwtftqhk81.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5b5d80deba7f79ca65b2ec00befb8dcd97dbdb6)

Reed accomplished 419 tackles, 3 sacks, 9 INTs ,19 deflections, & 3 forced fumbles for the Blue Raiders. Today's NFL requires defenders to be able to be multiple in both their skillset & positional alignment. Blankenship has the fundamentals & tenacity to be a box safety, combined with the ball-skills to play in the middle of the field. I wanted to improve the safety depth as felt Brady Breeze was just a joke. Kevin Byard was a Blue Raider too! Having Reed learn from Kevin is too good to be true for us.

[Rachaad White](https://preview.redd.it/1l1ulmthrhk81.jpg?width=3200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6737162b666e4630ba80c8534d2511f876bd367)

White consistently shows vision to find the best lane & some physical toughness to gain yards after contact. Rachaad is a smooth route-runner creating separation against linebackers. The Sun Devil has strong hands & can pluck the ball out of the air. As a runner, Rachaad has light feet in open space & can maneuver through traffic as he pushes up the field. Rachaad has the best receiving skills of any back in the class & could quite easily be used as a wideout at a pinch. White is RB7 on my board. I was disappointed I did not reach earlier for Kenneth Walker or Breece Hall, while selecting Austin & Bonitto. As Walker is from Arlington, TN. Yet some things happen for a reason!

**RB:** After spending too much on Melvin Gordon III as a special JRob experiment, I was still not done at RB. Jon has a heartfelt attachment for previously injured players. Melvin is that rehabilitation or recovering experiment as Melvin did incur a hip injury in 2021 for the Broncos. I think Rachaad is a perfect compliment to Henry's game, as the previous paragraph explains with White's receiving skills. In case MG3 or Darrynton Evans cannot fully recover to past form. Please note, this pick is no insult to Derrick Henry. This is not taking food off Derrick's plate. This pick is to simply improve the depth of the entire TEN RB room.

[Brock Hoffman](https://preview.redd.it/a45c6yvzthk81.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1b74f09cdbe3431fd73c8140feeba68c3fe3d84)

Ben Jones can perform somersaults, yet this pick can learn from Ben. Brock has started at least 21 games for the Hoakies at center so the experience inside is there. Hoffman shined in the Shrine Bowl.

[Markquese Bell](https://preview.redd.it/kwv7o0xiuhk81.jpg?width=3276&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bba5e99a24f032b544f3989b3ae1d253a80dee44)

This is 2nd hardest hitting safety in this draft class. The other safety being UGA Lewis Cine (taken at #67 overall). Bell was given three all-star invitations to the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, East/West Shrine Bowl, & the Reese's Senior Bowl. I think Bell was the only NCAA prospect that received all three invitations. When I watch this FCS prospect on tape, I see an enforcer, who takes pleasure in laying down the boom stick. I think Reed & Bell can be a great duo in the future. I also returned Dane Cruikshank & Jamal Carter as our six safeties.

[Cade York](https://preview.redd.it/8xv45pf8vhk81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9766627aa2a2bcf35dd10efddf05d68d5041c98b)

TEN needs a future kicker. I fully believe in the talent of York. As my war room saw & pinpointed how Cade made a game winning FG for the Tigers against Florida with rain, water, pressure, & a glaring LED light all in York's face. It's what one does when the wind is going against them that matters, not with them, that makes the player stand out for the next level.

[James Houston IV](https://preview.redd.it/txjwgxttvhk81.jpg?width=683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dce1e8fda16a1f1769bbb77e379f94a6398d9109)

James has bend, motor, defensive mentality, & play-making ability are intrinsic to him as a high-quality prospect. Ranks 2nd among FCS players with 12.5 sacks & tied for fifth with 18.5 tackles for loss. Houston showed toughness & ability to play on the ball & off the ball in the Shrine Bowl practices. In the Shrine Bowl itself, James gave QB Brock Purdy a bunch of pressure in the game on many snaps. From the HBCU event, Jackson State linebacker James Houston continued to turn heads for the second consecutive week. After a strong performance at the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, Houston got the call-up to the Shrine Bowl & finished with a bang. A traditional pass-rusher at the college ranks, Houston demonstrated the ability to play off-ball backer, After 16.5 sacks, 70 tackles, 24.5 tackles for losses, 10 QB hits, 7 forced fumbles (No. 4 in FCS), 2 fumble recoveries, & 2 TDs. James needs to add some weight as only 226 lbs to be an ILB. It is debatable if one wants to place James as an OLB instead of ILB. Since I was able to acquire Bointto, Fowler, & Okoronkwo as more OLB depth. I felt we needed to have James be an ILB for us instead, if James can gain about 20 lbs of weight at the Titans training facility. Many coaches & teammates refer to James as **""The Problem"".**

[Chigoziem Okonkwo](https://preview.redd.it/g7lw4f31xhk81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7dc2ae61cbf0eb4ddee27bb4e66e8fe430426775)

TEN has officially met with Okonkwo. The only other reported visit the Titans have made is Nevada QB Carson Strong. I really like the TE duo of Likely & Okonkwo. I felt Konk should have been long gone & taken by other teams back in round 5. I personally know writer Justin Melo will approve of this pick!

[Eric Johnson](https://preview.redd.it/exas44urxhk81.jpg?width=2618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39274659e54bed7bbdbb6992c04799018473335)

Eric was a standout at the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. Which helped Johnson receive a late invitation to the Senior Bowl. He arrived in Mobile & turned heads, not missing a beat from his outstanding performance in Pasadena, CA. At 6' 4"", 302 lbs, almost 35"" arms, he's quite a handful. He's got a good mix of quickness & body control. Johnson is some decent depth at DE mixed in with Winfrey, Hand, & Murch. Many coaches & teammates refer to Eric as **""The Creature""**.

**UDFAs:**

I was not going to spend a draft pick on Tyler Vrabel. Yet, it was a perfect landing for both parties with Tyler as an UDFA. Aztec & teammate of Matt Araiza, CB Taylor Hawkins really caught my eye and attention as the defensive MVP in the Shrine Bowl with 2 INTs. 2 other CBs of CJ Holmes & Dallis Flowers will definitely give TEN a boost of underrated talent in the CB room. Mike Hughes replaces Janoris Jenkins' roster spot. Holmes was coached up by Deion Sanders. Deven Thompkins is a speed WR just like Calvin Austin as has kick return experience. Calvin Turner to me is almost like a gadget weapon relative to Cordarelle Patterson or Tony Pollard. Kalil Pimpleton has punt return experience. Jalen McKenzie & Andrew Rupcich are both solid OL on their own. Chris Elmore replaced Tory Carter's roster spot as our next fullback. Elmore is known to Syracuse teammates as **""rhino""**. Derrick needs & deserves a rhino in front of him to clear some space on some obvious rushing snaps. CJ Brewer & Ralf Rusins are more IDL depth. The 90th man was none other than Eastern Washington QB Eric Barriere Jr to be our QB4. Hopefully, none of the other 31 teams poach our QB4 off the PS. As Eric can eventually be our backup QB, when Mike White becomes a free agent in 2023. 

**Final cuts:** 

Tommy Hudson, Tory Carter, Christian DiLauro, Dustin Hopkins, Phillip Walker, Rodney Clemons, Shyheim Carter, Daniel Munyer, Chris Williamson, Kevin Strong, Ryan Izzo

Who makes the final 53 is definitely not my problem. That is up to the entire coaching staff & executives. I delivered & built a list of 90 players under contract for summer camp for the Tennessee Titans. My final cap space is positive **$4.2 million**.

Every transaction, pick, & UDFA offer conducted above was formally performed with thought & craftsmanship. Hopefully, this helps all appreciate how much work goes on behind the scenes in a NFL off-season.

Please tell me what you think about what I did for the franchise. I was born in Nashville, TN miles away from Nissan Stadium at what used to be known as Baptist Hospital.

1.) Ryan Tannehill has peaked as a QB, and he is not capable of elevating our offense to an elite level.

2.) Our offense & pass defense are both very bad, and even if they reach average levels, and we somehow win the division, they will not be good enough to compete in the playoffs. 

3.) If we bottom out and get a top 3 pick, we should at least see what Levis has to offer in regular season games before picking another QB in the draft. Otherwise, we effectively wasted the 33rd pick in the 2023 Draft. Malik Willis may be more competitive than Will Levis right now, but I don’t see any situation where we pass up on Williams or Maye if we have a top 3 pick.",OGTITANSFAN,2023-09-26 17:17:41,"[('team performance', -0.34), ('coaching and management', 0.11)]"

Some glaring issues everyone sees in his play calling Vrabel should notice. Then Vrabel was 2 or 3 words away today from saying playcalling is overrated....so hear me out. 

Vrabel was a Defensive player and coach. Defensive play callers do not need to be as savvy as offensive play callers. Some are but it's not a necessity Vrabel is/was not a good DC either. 

So I believe Vrabel's biggest problem is he does not understand what the difference is between Arthur Smith and Todd D. He believes anyone just needs to call a play and players need to execute. He doesn't understand the nuance of using the run to set up PA. Or airing it out to set up the run. He is stuck in a Defensive mind where they have a handful of schemes and it's about player execution. Not how those schemes are called, as long as the call gets in ontime the play caller did their job (another Vrabel quote) 

Also I am starting to get really disappointed in him for not praising Chig. Dude is our top performer and Vrabes says chig needs to improve on the line but he does great on Special Teams.

It’s a ridiculously difficult drill, Tannehill couldn’t even make one. Richardson is just hitting a target on a run staring it down the whole time? It’s so much easier.

I know you guys are high on Corall but I personally believe this may tbe the first year in a while no QB goes in the first. If Malik Willis slips to your pick would you be open to taking him over Corall or taking him at all?

I remember vividly while I was in the hospital watching the playoff game against Baltimore a couple of seasons ago. You guys had the Ravens right where you wanted them and then Lamar Jackson broke off on an electricity if TD run and it completely zapped the air out of your stadium and completely shifted the tides and morale at that point leading to a loss.

1267,16sa6rb,We're Better Off Going 7-9 Than Tanking,"A commenter in another thread prompted me to do a little digging on how effective tanking is in getting that Super Bowl winning QB. Let's take a look at the last 10 Super Bowl winners, and what their record was the year before they got their QB:

2023 Kansas City - Mahomes, 12-4 (2016-2017)

2022 LA Rams - Stafford, 10-6 (2020-2021)

2021 Tampa Bay - Brady, 7-9 (2019-2020)

2020 Kansas City - Mahomes, 12-4 (2016-2017)

2019 New England - Brady, 8-8 (1999-2000)

2018 Philadelphia - Foles, 7-9 (2016-2017), Wentz , 7-9 (2015-2016)

2017 New England - Brady, 8-8 (1999-2000)

2016 Denver - Manning, 8-8 (2011-2012)

2015 New England - Brady, 8-8 (1999-2000)

2014 Seattle - Wilson, 7-9 (2011-2012)

So interestingly enough, every single Super Bowl winner of the last decade picked their QB coming off of a 7-9 or better season. 

Maybe tanking for a flyer on a college QB while we don't have an OL is a terrible idea. It sure hasn't worked for anyone else the last 10 years. ",Falconman21,2023-09-26 01:27:27,"[('team performance', 0.05), ('coaching and management', -0.1), ('pricing', 0.03), ('miscellaneous', 0.04)]"

I read a comment the other day that “we had a window and it passed”.  As much as I hate to say it aloud, more and more I’m agreeing.  Looking at DH and RT17s contracts made me run through a scenario that I’d love to get input on. 

Let’s say we trade both of them for draft picks. We DON’T trade up in the first round for a QB, but draft Bijan Robinson and Hendon Hooker. 

Hooker gets a year of being QB1. If he shows well, we stick with him. If he doesn’t, we are most likely in the Caleb Williams running for 2024. 

Departing from two stars like Tannehill and Henry will likely lose a portion of the un-initiated fan base, but bringing in a local TN QB in Hooker will keep the sheep at bay. 

Best case scenario: Hooker bounces back from his injury and kills it at QB1, and we have future draft picks to build around him. 

Worst case scenario: Hooker can’t come back from the injury, we collapse in 2023 and we are full out Caleb Williams sweepstakes. 

Either way, we put ourselves in position for future picks for a solid rebuild.

1309,10fpta6,Offseason Post: What could a future with Lamar Jackson look like?,"The thought of seeing Lamar and Henry on the same offense for at least the next two years sounds like such a dream, but I wonder if it could happen. If negotiations between the Ravens and Lamar start to deteriorate, possible with his mom being his agent, and the Ravens decide to tag and trade Lamar it feels like the Titans could be a good fit with a rebuild at o-line also necessary. 

My thought is that the Titans can trade down our first (11) and second round pick and potentially a future 2024 pick for the Ravens first round pick (22) and 3rd round pick, perhaps include Tannehill or cut him to open up cap space. Cut Dupree, Lewan and open up some cap space to re-sign Simmons and draft an LT in the first round. The trade would allow the Ravens to get a 2nd round pick back, and move up in the draft. It would leave the Titans with a decent first round pick to still grab a decent LT, and set them up with a QB for a long time. Main concerns would be the cost and cap space of Lamar and his injury history. 

Not sure if this is actually possible but wanted to open up the discussion since why the hell not, it’s the offseason. 

Personally I think we should stick with Tannehill for a year or two while we look for a QB to draft or develop later, but it’s fun to think about. I also think I am a bit more concerned about Lamar’s injury history compared to Tannehill. I am wondering if Lamar can open up our offense a bit more and run some more RPO. Going to be interesting seeing what GM Ran does and what the OC hire says about the direction they are taking the offense in the future. 

I know some of y’all have a better grasp of the draft, cap, and player or draft value, but thought I would throw it out there for your feedback.",gatsby712,2023-01-19 02:21:53,"[('team performance', -0.28), ('coaching and management', -0.22), ('miscellaneous', -0.09)]"

1311,16s9xn4,This Franchise is so frustrating,"Watching the TITANS is just frustrating. Our OL is garbage right now but it’s no excuse for Tannehill to be so bad. He looks lost out there and afraid to run the ball. It’s been like this for years. I remember when McNair was there throwing and running, we had Moon who had a great arm. We have gone through so many QBs and just can’t find one. If you don’t have a qb in this league it’s going to be long seasons. We’ve lost 8 out of 9 games and can’t score points. Something has to change bc I’m tired of watching this team go 3 and out more and more every week. Enough excuses about wr bc we have ones that can play. We need to find a qb plain and simple and until then we will be near the bottom of the league.

So i was wondering, who else was on the board, worth picking, that made sense as our 2nd round pick? Open up the draft board, and in theory everyone past 33 or 41 is available.

I genuinlely am curious, because when people argue ""we should have taken a WR"" or ""we should have taken that"", i dont see a player that made sense to take in the 2nd round. not one WR is worth to me that high in the 2nd. I guess there are a couple of OG's available to reinforce our Oline... or a C... Tippman is the closest who was drafted by the Jets.

But in terms of needs and who was available, Levis was the best player available and i dont fault them at all getting him instead of some highly questionable WR in the 2nd. And yes, just because you run a mid 4,4 and come from Ole Miss, it doesnt mean you are the next coming of AJB or Metcalf.",saradahokage1212,2023-05-10 18:27:50,"[('team performance', 0.05), ('coaching and management', 0.09)]"

1349,11nk0cs,Lamar Jackson,"Trade for Lamar Jackson.... yes or no??

***WHY WE SHOULD DO IT***

1. Lamar is a true game-changer when healthy and is a proven MVP-caliber QB. I believe Lamars durability and accuracy issues have been overstated (but they are still a concern). Mostly everyone on the Ravens in the last 3 years has been injured, and Lamar for the most part was the only thing holding the offense together. When Lamar starts the Ravens are 45-16 & the offense took a big step back when he was off the field.
2. I also think Lamar has never had any real help offensively and would benefit greatly from DH, Chig & Treylon if used correctly. Imagine the rushing nightmare of stopping el tractorcito and then a bullet like Lamar. It would be a nightmare for coaches.
3. Lamar is relatively inexpensive. Kyler ""Warzone"" Murray just signed a 5-year/$230 Million contract. Rusell Wilson just went for Drew Lock, Noah Fant, Shelby Harris, and two first-round picks (2022-No. 9 overall  & 2023 - No. 5 overall) & cost 5 years/$242 Million. Deshaun Watson went for three first-round picks (2022 - No. 13 & 2023 - No. 12 & 2024 first-rounder), No. 73 - 2023 draft + 2024 fourth-rounder & 5 years/$230 million fully guaranteed. I understand we would give up 2 first-round picks & probably have to guarantee \~$200 million to him, but if Lamar is able to stay healthy and return to MVP form nobody will be complaining about the price.
4. With Vrabel as a head coach drafting a franchise QB will be virtually impossible. In order to be able to get a franchise QB you have to be in the top 1-5 range in the draft. I don't see a scenario where we are bad enough with Vrabel to get to that position. With that being said, we will have to give up HUGE draft capital to get ""our guy"" if we do decide to draft a QB. IMO we would have to give up at least three 1st round picks to move up and get Bryce Young or CJ Stroud or Caleb Williams ect.. the most we would give up draft capital wise is two 1st round picks.

***WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO IT***

1. Lamar does have an injury history and his inability to advance as a passer is very concerning. He has missed at least 5 games in each of his last 2 years and has never started a full 16/17 games in his entire career. This is concerning. Lamar could end up tearing his ACL on the first snap we could potentially be screwed for the entire contact.
2. Lamar missing his team's playoff game is very concerning to me. I understand that he was injured, but Lamar didn't even travel with the team to the game. That seems like a HUGE red flag that nobody is speaking about. It might just be me, but it's very concerning to see my leader not only not play through an injury in the playoffs, but not even show up to support the team.
3. If we trade for Lamar we will still remain a running football team at heart. There is no way that you have Lamar Jackson and turn into an air raid offense. I would like to see the Titans re-establish their own identity and move away from the running attack, if we were to trade for Young, Stroud, Caleb Williams, or even Aaron Rodgers all of those guys would give us the ability to use a more pass-first offensive scheme.
4. The cost would be MASSIVE. I don't know what Lamar wants, but it wouldn't surprise me if he was asking for over $200 million guaranteed. This would easily be the largest FA acquisition in the franchises and would also cost at least two first-round picks as well.

***DIFFERENT STRATEGY***

I don't see the Ravens/Lamar coming to an agreement before the draft, and from reports, there are a lot of teams already OUT on Lamar Jackson. If Lamar is still available AFTER the draft we should definitely make an offer to him & attempt to trade Tannehill. Not only would we keep the #11 pick and be able to draft as is, but we will only give up 2024 & 2025 1st round picks, which will hopefully be 32 each year.

***My Personal Thoughts***

I think we should atleast see what Lamar wants, I'm shocked that so many teams are refusing to even negotiate when there was a bigger market for Deshaun Watson and Russell Wilson. If we can wait until after the draft I would LOVE to try and sign Lamar away from the Ratbirds and REALLY make them regret letting their guy go.

1372,xyet90,QB Derek Carr Could Resurrect His Career Elsewhere,"We all know how Ryan Tannehill left one team Miami and went to another Tennessee and suddenly he is playing better,winning more games because he had the help he needed to thrive here.

I have always thought Derek Carr was a good QB and i think Carr could resurrect his career if he went to a better place

I think Carr's issues are very similar to the ones Tannehill had 

Carr's rookie season (3-13) the Raiders were 32nd dead last in scoring defense, his second season (7-9) 22nd in scoring defense,third season 20th in scoring defense but that season overcame it enough to make the postseason with a winning record (12-4).

2017 his fourth year (6-10) they were 20th in scoring defense and gave up 30 or more points in six different losses.

2018 his fifth year (4-12) the Raiders were 32nd dead last in scoring defense giving up 30 or more points in half of their games.

2019 his sixth year (7-9) they were 24th in scoring defense and in a three game stretch gave up 34 to the Jets,40 to the Chiefs and 42 at home to the Titans

2020 his seventh year (8-8) they were 30th in scoring defense and gave up 30 or more points in 5 of their first 6 games and altogether 10 games giving up 30 or more points.

2021 his eighth year (10-7) the Raiders were 26th in scoring defense and despite having a bad defense he and the team overcame it and made the postseason for just the second time in Carr's eight years.

So lets see the defenses were ranked 32nd, 22nd, 20th, 20th, 32nd, 24th, 30th, 26th in points allowed so Carr has always been held back by bad defenses and blown leads.

In Carr's first eight seasons he had just two with a winning record and playoff berth.

With the defense blowing leads regularly Carr had plenty of chances to try and engineer 4th quarter comebacks and game winning drives and thats what he did.

Carr has had 30 game winning drives and 24 fourth quarter comebacks

Carr for his career has completed 2990 of 4610 passes, 65% comp rate, 32738 yards, 199 TDs, 89 INTs

This year they are 1-3 the defense is 23rd and the team has given up 24,29,24 and 23 points and have lost by just 5 to the Chargers, lost by just 6 to the Cards and lost by just 2 to the Titans.

Carr is very durable missing only 2 starts in his 9 year career so far.

At the moment imagine a team that could be really good but don't have a competent QB 

As crazy as it sounds and i really hope it never happens but i wouldn't put it past the Colts owner Jim Irsay to dial the Raiders up in the coming offseason with a trade proposal if Matt Ryan doesn't work out.

I do think that Washington,Carolina,Houston and possibly even Atlanta will all be vying for the top two QBs Bryce Young and CJ Stroud.",titanfan8,2022-10-08 00:33:23,"[('team performance', 0.08), ('coaching and management', -0.1), ('media coverage', 0.04), ('miscellaneous', 0.05)]"
1373,xj9l4a,The “Patriot Way” can only work for one coach and one QB,"Teams bring in GMs and coaches from the Belichick/Brady era and they all do the same thing. Undervalue talent and overvalue UDFA’s and role players. Ryan Tannehill is no Tom Brady, he can’t turn a Wr3-4 on another team to a wr1. Tanny is also the largest cap hit currently in the NFL which doesn’t help the team succeed in anyway. 

Jrob has been the best GM in the titans era at drafting talent, but he lets players walk the same way Belicheck does. Jack Conklin, Jonnu smith, Corey Davis to some extent, Aj brown all are better than what we have right now. It’s hard to hit on draft talent at a position and it’s even harder to do it again. 

Only one team in one era have won this way and that’s because they had the best QB of all time. Hopefully we can get some reboot in thinking after some tough losses because we won’t succeed without it. Also put Tim Kelly in at OC.

1398,zjnp8p,"We need a modern NFL offense if we want long term success, and that might mean an offense without Henry","The age of the bell-cow back is long gone. What the Titans have done with Henry the last 6 seasons is literally the last vestige of this style of play. Maybe you could argue the Browns and Nick Chubb run the same style, but they also air it out with Amari Cooper, DPJ and Deshaun Watson. The run game is essential especially in the playoffs but the league is beyond 4 yards and a cloud of dust, bone crushing, meet me in the hole running.

Where does that leave us? It leaves us in need of a major overhaul... Right now our team is a 1986 K5 Chevy Blazer and we're trying to race 2022 Corvettes... Sure, a Corvette can't pull a tree out of the ground, but a K5 Blazer can't corner, handle, or accelerate like the Corvette... Plus, our old Blazer is hard to get going when it's cold due to it's carbeurated fuel delivery system and the fact that it's got about 250k miles on the block... Add in the rust damage, the crack in the frame, lost compression in cylinder 3, failing leaf springs, and that annoying ticking lifter when it's cold and I'd say it's safe to say we need to retire the old girl out to pasture.

Does this mean we need to get rid of Henry? I want to say no, especially as he's essentially been the sole reason for our success these past 5 years, but the league isn't built for Chevy Blazer backs like him anymore... Today's game plan favors Corvette guys like Christian McCaffrey, Joe Mixon, D'Onta Foreman (rip), Isiah Pacheco, and Alvin Kamara; quick and agile backs that are also dangerous in the passing game. Henry would have thrived in Mike Shanahan's zone run scheme with Denver in the 90s, but he's lost a step since his foot injury whether that's due to timidity or lack of physical ability, and it may be best to move on at this point.

The offense doesn't necessarily have to be pass first, but it needs to be more pass dominant. My favorite offenses to watch in this regard are Kansas City, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Andy Reid, Kyle Shanahan, and Nick Sirianni all employ pre-snap motion to identify defensive assignments as well as get offensive guys moving with momentum on jet-sweep/counter runs. Wide receivers and tight ends play more hybrid roles rather than traditional roles, catching out of the backfield and out of bunch/spread sets. In terms of the running backs, it's by committee, and the runs are usually zone scheme running out of the gun or in a single back/pistol formation to retain the threat of the pass while masking the run. These schemes are all based on keeping defenses on their heels so they can never get comfortable and keep them guessing. Our offense is so predictable Todd Downing may as well have given the opposing coach our playbook.

With a new GM coming to town, I would not be surprised with Henry's departure. We have a lot of money tied up in him and we're simply not getting our return. I don't think it's necessarily likely, especially since this season could just be chalked up to Henry's first season back from a foot injury and a non-existent offensive line, but perhaps at the end of next season we see a changing of the guard. Most of it comes down to whether or not Vrabel survives the new GM hire. Of course, our scheme overall needs to favor more passing with some stud pass catchers (See Burks and Chig), but if we really want to be successful it's time we step into the 21st century offensively.

Edit: Before you all crucify me, I love Derrick Henry. He's a fucking beast and he may be the greatest RB to ever wear the two-tone blue, but I'd argue his success has been in spite of the offensive culture of the league rather than in tandem/because of it.

I looked him up recently to see if maybe he picked up football again and didn't realize he as young as he was (I thought we drafted him earlier than we did). If he were still playing he'd be the same age as Ryan so very likely playing, which made me think. If we had stuck it out with him, and he never retired, would we be any good now? Do you think he could've improved or would we be an 8-8 team every year?

1418,11t9oia,Should the Titans seriously consider making Llamar Jackson an offer?,"I didn't even seriously consider this until about 3 days ago.  I was very surprised when the Ravens put the unrestricted tag on him and had been expected them to inevitably come to a long term deal with him.  As it stands,  it seems to me that Llamar wants a top contract in the NFL and the Ravens don't believe: A) that he is worth it ; B) that another team will give it to him (in addition to two 1st Rd Picks).

DONT DO IT:

1) Tannehill vs Lamar the last few years are very similar.  The side by side stats are for the most part the same.  How much of an upgrade is it really?

2) LJ has missed a ton of games the last 2 years.  Injuries have been an issue for him and with his style of play there is no guarantee he will available enough to warrant a monster contract. 

3)  Its time for the Titans offense to enter the new era of offense (10 years later).  Bringing in LJ is the opposite direction most of us were hoping the offensive play calling to go and would all but guarantee we remain at the top of the league with percentage of plays we run the ball.  

4)  Not much post season success.  Most of his allure comes from regular season success and he has underperformed in the games that matter most.  

5) Two 1st Rd picks are very valuable, especially at #11 overall.  That combined with the his cap hit, it will be difficult to build talent at other positions.

DO IT:

1)  LJ is currently 6th in odds to win the MVP next year.  He already has an MVP under his belt.  We are talking about a player who the general public believes takes a team to another level.  

2) Tannehill had his window.  While many of us believe Tannehill has played in the top tier since he has been a Titan, most NFL fans have stead fast thinking we are not a real contender with him at the helm.  Henry carried us through his first playoff run,  He choked his second year and was able to play this year.  Im good with giving him another chance but I'm ready to move on.  

3)  It gives us the best chance to win this year.  It's hard to argue we are contenders right now, and the sports book's have us as a bottom 5 team.  If we bring in LJ we go from bottom 5 to top 12 overnight.  It would only take 3-0 before EVERYONE would have us in the top 5.

4)  We are not going to have very good receiving options this year.  Burks and Chig have big potential but even if they both have great years its still a weakness.  FA pool is dry and it sounds like a weak position for this years draft.  Even if its a priority to improve this area, its hard to see this group as being a plus.  

5)  Read option with LJ and Henry would be ELECTRIC.  The expectation for me would be to have to most combined rushing yards for 2 players on one team of ALL time.  For a defender that has to read whether LJ is going to keep of hand it to Henry, there is no way they could cover both.  Explosive runs all day. 

Conclusion:

My overall thoughts are that I'm am very hesitant because it seems like a boom or bust.  Could lead to immediate contention and a Championship in the next few years or could cripple the cap and draft capital and bring back dark days.  My interest in Llamar came out of nowhere a couple days ago, and the more I think about it, the more I feel like this is the best landing spot for him.

1419,16m7ci4,Snap Counts & Play Breakdowns,"Going to do my armchair coaching, flame me if you want, this is just sharing my thoughts.

I feel like one of the biggest, if not the biggest, issues with our offense is how we blatantly telegraph our game plan based on who is at RB.  It was better week 2 than it was week 1, but Henry gets the ball 50-60% of the time when he's in and Spears got it around 15% week 1 and like 30% week 2.  Don't quote my numbers, idk where to find all the exact stats, but making it that obvious when we're run first or pass first makes it so much tougher on everybody.  It seems hard to blame the O Line or Tannehill for poor play when defenses know what we want to do once they see who is in at RB.

Basing this a lot on eyeball test so if anybody knows where to see more in depth breakdowns I'd love to see it, but TLDR is I feel like if we don't balance our packages and play breakdown our offense won't succeed.

EDIT: This isn't an exercise in using hindsight to redraft the best players available, this is to see how much better or worse the free ""expert"" consensus rankings available for each draft would have done in the draft had we simply picked the best player available (except where noted).

2017: Marshon Lattimore over Corey Davis

OJ Howard over Adoree Jackson

2018: Calvin Ridley over Rashaan Evans

2019: Montez Sweat over Jeff Simmons

2020: Xavier McKinney over Isaiah Wilson - with Kevin Byard signed long-term no chance we draft a FS so interestingly enough the next pick would've been Kristian Fulton.

2021: Caleb Farley over Caleb Farley??!! With Lattimore on the team we go next on the list and pick Christian Darrisaw (OT doing very well with the Vikings)

2022: Jermaine Johnson over Treylon Burks - had we not traded AJ Brown, Johnson would have still been available at our original pick 26.

1436,scvnw4,Unpopular opinion and question.,"I’m of the belief and argument we had the exact same play call style from Smith to Downing.  Smith just looked like a genius because less injuries and weaker schedule.  Also Henry had arguably the greatest season in HB history in 20’.  

Point being when Henry is on his game in a full season we can afford to get away with run, run, pass.  The pitfall of this team in the last 3 playoff exits really was An inability to adapt to what was given.  I too thought Smith was an offensive Genius until I saw him run Henry into a brick wall 17 times in the wildcard game. That game proved to me that Smith wasn’t that special.  We had a generational offense from the franchise standpoint, but were left with our heads up our butts when Henry couldn’t break 38 yards after his 16th attempt (and that was in the 4th quarter).

All this to say Tanny lost us that game no doubt.  But since we undoubtedly are stuck with him why don’t we play to his strengths.  Besides making basic play calls (cough sneak on 3rd and 1) we can roll out more, take more shots (yes believe it or not we throw way to many intermediate scared routes), and just simply get creative.  News flash lining up Henry for a direct snap sweep is not creative.

Now to the point of this post.  I’m my opinion Our issue is also our greatest Strength: Vrabel.  His stubbornness and old school mentality that players love is also our pitfall with how we call plays, the Dean Pees situation in the AFC championship, etc.  we simply don’t adapt from a play call perspective.  

The obvious rebuttal here is yeah but we got the 1 seed with a record number of players.  My answer: Yes that is impressive, but I lend that more to the “next man up, do your job mentality” I said Vrabel was liked for rather than the brains of the staff in how they game plan.

I love Vrabel but we need to change some things up if we want to go on a run.",Titansguy12,2022-01-26 03:06:19,"[('coaching and management', 0.3), ('team performance', -0.18)]"

Jeffrey Simmons - Top 10 talent but injured and character concerns

Rashaan Evans - Modern big play LB but not sound in fits/tackling/coverage

Corey Davis - Height/weight/speed guy but G5 School product

Adoree Jackson - Undersized burner with return potential with injury concerns

Jack Conklin - Maybe the only exception to this concept as he came in as a steady, high ceiling OT

Taking a QB at any point in the 1st round is the ultimate risk/reward HR Swing

* **Post June 1 2023 Release of Tannehill saves $27 million against the cap** ([https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/tennessee-titans/ryan-tannehill-9818/](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/tennessee-titans/ryan-tannehill-9818/))

This is of particular of importance because the entire 2019 Titans Draft Class (Simmons, AJB, Nate Davis, Hooker, David Long) hits FA following the 2022 season. Tannehill's $27 million would go a long way in re-signing these guys.

Quote from Jon Robinson during his post-season interview: ""You’re trying to get younger, you’re trying to get less expensive, you’re trying to do all that. That’s no secret. 32 teams are trying to do the same thing: trying to get as young and as cheap on the roster as possible as you can on the roster because it gives you staying power in the National Football League. ""

* **The 2022 QB Class offers the Titans a unique opportunity to get a top-3 QB in the Class**

It is rare for a team with the record of success the Titans have had during JRob's tenure to have the opportunity to get one of the top-3 QBs in a class. For context:

2021 - QBs went 1,2,3 

2020 - Joe Burrow, Tua, and Justin Herbert went 1,5,6 

2019 - The late Dwayne Haskins was the 3rd QB off the board at pick 15

2018 - Josh Allen was the 3rd QB off the board at pick 7

2017 - Deshaun Watson was the 3rd QB off the board at pick 12

2016 - Paxton Lynch (ugh) was the 3rd QB off the board at 26

In short, it has been 6 years since the 3rd QB in a draft class made it to pick 26. With a 4-year playoff streak alive - the Titans don't appear to be in position to make a selection in the top half of the draft any time soon. 

In short, 2022 offers the Titans a unique opportunity to get a top-3 QB for incredibly cheap who can allow the Titans to re-sign key members of the roster to expand their contending window to 2023 and beyond.",DSFIGHT42,2022-04-25 15:18:02,"[('team performance', -0.01), ('media coverage', -0.03), ('coaching and management', 0.02)]"

1459,16w876h,Ran Carthon’s “Golden State Warrior football” offseason comments,"Ran had one consistent message throughout the offseason roster building process: “you don’t want to be playing ‘golden state warrior football’ in December and January (which the Warriors have created the closest thing to an NBA dynasty since Jordan’s Bulls - neither here nor there).”

We all got the message - as Titans fans we have never seen a team play “golden state warrior football” (2021 would be the closest). But then he goes out and builds a finesse offense around 11 personnel - indicating we want to play “golden state warrior football”. So if our goal is to NOT play “golden state warrior football” in December & January (as Ran stated) then he’s trying to do it with basically:
- 1 TE (Chig struggles in the run and Whyle is not an NFL player at the moment) 
- LT that is suppose to be a good “athlete” in pass pro along with other “athletic” OL.
- 7 WRs and none of which are big bodied guys that will excel in blocking front 7 defenders if motioned and assigned to them
- 1 RB that appears to be a “golden state football” player

My point being - there’s no way Ran actually meant those comments. Everything we have done on the offensive side of the ball indicates we ARE trying to play “Golden State football”. 

(Which creates our offensive struggles because Tannehill and Henry epitomize NOT playing “golden state warrior football”. We trying to fit a round peg into a square hole.)

So two conclusions from those comments:

1. (most likely) - It was a smokescreen as we were trying to trade Derrick Henry. He clearly does not fit into the offensive scheme we have at the moment but is the perfect back for NOT playing “golden state football”. We all know Henry needs 25 touches a game because it wears the defense down and then he starts to get going. Nothing of our offense is built to do that.

2. He actually thinks he’s built an offense that is capable of playing of not playing “golden state warrior football” in December or January… which I’m not ready to believe he’s that incompetent at the moment.

Either way - both cast Ran Carthon in a negative light for me.


Hopefully Henry goes for 150 tomorrow against the Bengals and I look like a huge idiot, but at the moment, it appears that we’re watching a slow end to Henry’s Titans career. And even if it’s time, it’s still sad as there isn’t many more football players that have brought me more joy than Derrick Henry.",mwf_at8,2023-09-30 14:26:32,"[('coaching and management', -0.08), ('team performance', -0.31), ('miscellaneous', -0.13)]"

1469,snsgvc,Discussion," 

So just curious for discussion purposes no straight bashing bullshit cause thats old, but if you start a game 3 drives and 17 points of that your QB goes 11 for 17 with 138 yards and 1 TD but you call running 7 of 11 plays plus a scramble for 3 drives who is at fault? Or how about going 11 passes of 20 plays getting 10 points but abandon the 50-50 play calling to go more run and not getting anywhere who is at fault?

Sure Tannehill wasn't good against Cincy but there was a lot of questionable play calling from the staff. I wont blame any single person as there are multiple people you should blame. But to sit here and say oh Titans playoff losses are completely because of 1 person is just ridiculous. KC game Art went soft until down 28-17 but the defense also fell apart. Henry was trying and so was Tannehill thing is they were stunted by the OC. In Baltimore the defense showed up at times but forgot to tackle in others. The Oline was forcing quick pockets, there was no holes for Henry to run as 11 of his 18 were up the middle and werent going anywhere, his best run was to the outside and those were getting yards. Art was checked out and we all knew it when he left to ATL not even 4 hours after the loss. 

So the idea of blaming one person should be changed in my opinion. Nobody wins the superbowl alone. I dont care what some QB did 5-10 years ago that shit is old news. So if the Titans stay with Tannehill lets rally behind them and run it back, if they go out and move on from him lets rally behind whoever comes in as QB no matter who they are. Just my opinions take them for what its worth and dont come here with the bashing or nut hugging shit because its old.

1472,16eim19,Saints fan here,"To me this game is hard to call. Some New Orleans podcasters predict a Titans win. To me, both teams have one big issue to deal with. The Saints have to be able to stop the run, despite being 24th against the run last season. Now, supposedly our defensive tackles were to blame for that poor showing, and David Onyemata and Shy Tuttle signed elsewhere in the off-season. I’m excited about the addition of more athletic DT in Khalen Saunders and Nate Shepard. Hopefully they can do well enough to free up LB Demario Davis so he can wrap up Derrick Henry. But to me, our best run defender will be getting ahead early and staying ahead in this game, which would hopefully force Vrabel to lessen his use of King Henry. I don’t feel too confident in the Saints ability to run the ball in this game, but if we can give Derek Carr protection (it helps greatly that our O-line actually enters this game fully healthy), I do question how the Titans secondary is going to be able to contain Olave, Mike Thomas, Rasheed Shaheed and Juwan Johnson in the passing game.

I hate continuing to point out that our OC is the issue, but it’s glaring and obvious that that needs to change now. Not after the season or after the Jags win the South. The only thing that the Titans can control is getting rid of Todd and letting another Offensive mind throw together a game plan. Todd sucked with the Raiders and had sucked here. Vrabel needs to put his ego aside and just move on. 

I know it’s easier said than done, but for the sake of winning the division, making the playoffs, attempting a solid playoff run, or heck even a winning season, this needs to change.

1480,11ksn0p,1 year rebuild,"As the way things are going, the SB window has closed and I see the Titans stalling out if we continue with the Tannehill, Henry experiment that has a max efficiency time frame of 2 more years until a full rebuild is needed. No way in hell this team as currently constructed especially in the AFC can make a run, unless something drastically changes. Give me your opinions, but would you rather a 1 year rebuild/tank or continue to rock with the main guys for a couple more years? If I were GM my first order of business is as follows:

Trade Henry. Trade Tannehill. resign Jeff Simmons & Nate Davis.

Revamp the offensive line via Free agency/Draft, draft 1 wr any time rds 2-4, and possibly sign one. Also would draft a RB late around rds 5-7 to pair with Hilliard. a Foreman/Hilliard type combo could be just as effective as Henry, as we saw the year before.

Start Malik Willis. I know as of what we've seen he is terrible, but it doesn't hurt to start him for the whole year with an offseason under his belt and a revamped oline/wr core to see what hes made of. If he continues stinking it up, we can officially move on from the Malik Willis experiment and possibly land a top 5 pick to snag Caleb Williams as the franchise QB... if Malik shows promise then great, we know we got a guy that has potential and can continue to develop.

And with the success of recent second round receivers i don't think it'll be much of a drop off considering where the titans will be picking in the first.

I hope he proves me wrong and he kills it but from watching him I have little faith in that. he has so much athleticism but once you contain it he will not beat you throwing as easy as a lot of fans seem to think.

1521,zoidql,The next 3 weeks no longer matter....,"Titans are sitting at 7-6 with the next 3 games being @ Chargers, vs Texans and vs Cowboys on TNF. Because the Colts lost in epic fashion they now can no longer win the division even if both the Titans and Jags were to lose every game they have left. The Jags currently at 5-8 with their 3 games before the week 18 game with the Titans being vs Cowboys, @ Jets and @ Texans. Now the best the Jags could be going into week 18 is 8-8  by winning all 3 games. The Titans could lose the next 3 weeks and be 7-9 going into the final week of the season. If the Jags are 8-8 going into the week 18 then that game becomes winner take all. The reason it become winner take all because a Titans win would put them both 8-9, the first tie break is head-to-head which a week 18 win would make the series a split. So the second tie break is division record, Titans are currently 3-1 and the Jags are 2-2. Going into the week 18 game Titans would be 3-2 and Jags 3-2. So the Titans winning pushes them to 4-2 winning the division.

That is why the next 3 weeks do not matter for the Titans because at worse case a win against the Jags in week 18 will win the division for them at 8-9.

Not that I want the Titans to add their name to list of Division winners with losing records because when it happens everyone brings up that division winners shouldn't host a WC if they don't have a better record than the WC team. This is how its always been you win a division and you get to host a WC game.

So with this information everyone should just enjoy the RedZone channel the next few weeks instead of watching the Titans because they don't have to win till week 18 to win the division. Now the Titans can clinch next week with a win against the Texans and Jags losses to the Cowboys and Jets. Jags will be playing the Jets on TNF next week so the Titans will know whether or not they are playing for a division crown on Christmas Eve against the Texans.",firefighteremt19,2022-12-17 22:37:28,"[('team performance', 0.07), ('coaching and management', 0.06)]"

He has literally been the best thing to happen to the franchise see Steve and Eddie. All the accolades, and all the iconic moments beside it’s a new day for the organization. It’s gonna suck pretty bad if, or when he gets traded, but we need picks/cap space. If he gets traded to say the Falcons Rd 2nd, and 4th, or the Bears for one of their many picks I would begrudgingly be for it. This team needs to get healthy, and young quickly. Considering the conference they play in, (even with the probable two new young QB’s going to the Colts, and Texans) they still can be competitive next season, which is an optimistic outlook. If we’re gonna rebuild we have to be ready for the inevitable.

1537,11wlnb1,7 Round Mock Draft (w/ Explanations for each pick and trade + projected depth chart with draftees),"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mrzbr60fvwoa1.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fe974851cf7b614903742f547eef6ec36374c52

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Something that Ran has clearly valued in his FA moves so far are athleticism and youth. With guys like Sean Murphy-Bunting, Azeez Al-Shaair, and Arden Key, they not only play with great athleticism but have many playing years ahead of them due to their age. These two factors influenced but not fully determined my picks in this mock. 

&#x200B;

**Trades:**

Send: 1.11

Receive: 1.17, 2.49

&#x200B;

Send: 2.49

Receive: 2.60, 3.92

&#x200B;

At pick 1.11 and 2.49, I didn’t love any of the BPA in regards to our needs and we needed more picks, so I traded down with both picks (both had 75+% acceptance rates and were roughly equal to the value in the Jimmy Johnson draft pick value chart) to increase our asset pool. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Explanations:**

&#x200B;

1.17: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, WR, Ohio State- With Paris Johnson Jr. and Skoronski going off the board before pick 11 and many suitors for a trade down, I opted to pick up another premium day 2 pick while still getting my WR1 of this class. JSN provides a very skilled route-runner and separator with great agility to pair with Burks.

&#x200B;

2.41: Joe Tippmann, C, Wisconsin- Although the coaches and FO seem to like Aaron Brewer, Tippmann fits much better as a Ben Jones replacement. Joe Tippmann, who is 6’ 6” 313 lb, has elite athleticism for his size and looks to be a long-term starter at center for years to come.

&#x200B;

2.60: Blake Freeland, OT, BYU- The signing of Andre Dillard gives us a lot of flexibility in how we want to address the left side of the offensive line. Freeland is still pretty raw in his technique, but he moves extremely fluidly and well for being 6’ 8” and has among the highest athletic ability of any tackle in this class. He will need development, but with his age and having Dillard be able to take over as starter, Freeland will have plenty of time and not crucial pressure to immediately start. 

&#x200B;

3.72: Noah Sewell, LB, Oregon: This is probably my most questionable pick. Sewell had inconsistent tape and has a lot of work to do in his reaction timing and pass coverage technique, but his power, strength, and agility stand out significantly. With good coaching and development, Sewell would pair nicely with Al-Shaiir/Rice to lock down the LB core for the future. 

&#x200B;

3.92: Jonathan Mingo, WR, Ole Miss: Mingo is a very complete package when it comes to an outside receiver. He’s 6’ 2” 220 lb, ran a 4.46 40 yard dash with a 1.54 10 yard split, and he put up 22 reps on the bench to give him a 9.93 RAS score while being only 21 y/o. He was frequently played at TE due to his blocking ability, so he would be a great addition to the projected receiving core of Burks, JSN, NWI, and Philips. 

&#x200B;

5.148: Colby Wooden, EDGE, Auburn- Harold Landry and Arden Key project to be great edge rushers for the next few years, but you can’t have enough good edges. Wooden has nice potential and could be a solid rotational rusher with inside/outside versatility as he develops as a potential Autry replacement down the line. 

&#x200B;

6.185: DeWayne McBride, RB, UAB- I view McBride as a Hilliard replacement. He still needs to improve in the pass catching game, but he was good value at this draft position and would bring a more elusive running style to a room with Henry and Haskins. 

&#x200B;

7.229: Jake Moody, K, Michigan- Moody has elite leg strength, so getting a starting kicker was an easy option here.

&#x200B;

1540,yzw635,Tannehill,I know 90% this fan base still hates them and it’s deserved. But after the Cincy game I remember all the threats I was seeing on Tannehills Social media and his wife’s to include their kids. I want to at least applaud him for his game Thursday. I said it last week after his miserable start against the Broncos he needed to get that rhythm with the guys. And did they ever have it this week. I have a feeling we’re starting to see something beautiful happening right now. I think the Titans run it back tour just hid midway point and now it’s all the big hits coming.,strickyricky88,2022-11-20 05:31:22,"[('team performance', 0.5), ('media coverage', 0.08), ('coaching and management', 0.05)]"

1542,siwkve,"Do you believe Carson Wentz can get a complete Colts team to the superbowl and win it for them? If not you should be able to understand why a bunch of people dont believe tannelhill can get the job done for us. When you remove your homer glasses, you can see they are practically the same.","I've been... more present in this sub as of late because this is the only place I can properly vent. Coming into this game I knew we could lose but I never expected us to lose the way we did. Now I understand most of this sub wants to be optimistic. Wants to believe tannelhill can be that guy. I not trying to change your minds. Just want you to understand why I feel the way i do about tannelhill now. 

If you think tannelhill can get us to a super bowl and win Carson, in a very similar situation, should be able. These two quarterbacks are in a almost identical situations and, as much as we might wana deny, are kinda the same qb. This is the stats for this season. 

Ryans
Yd.3,734
Touchdowns 21
Interceptions 14
Passer ratings 89.6 

Carson
Yards 3,563
Touchdowns 27 
Interceptions 7
Passer ratings 94.6 

*if yal wana use tannelhills comeback player of the year stats you gotta use Carson MVP caliber stats. Same arguement. 1 years doesn't make you elite, consistency does. And if you consistently put up subpar playoff number well... your subpar in the playoffs🤷🏾‍♂️* 

Still based even based off what appears to be a very solid season can anyone honestly say that they would trust Carson wentz to take a complete colts team to the playoffs and win it all? Like not with JT going nuclear every game and their defense getting something like 9 sacks(🤯😭😭😭)in a game. If you can't then I think yal can see why a growing number of people in this sub believe tannelhill cant get us over the hump. 

Let's just look at tannelhill in the playoffs. 

Patriots 
Completed eight passes on 15 attempts for 72 yards with a touchdown and interception. 

Raven
Tannehill completed seven passes on 14 attempts for 88 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for one touchdown. Would yal call this his ""CLUTCH"" playoff win? Tannelhill best game in the post season by far and he only competes 7 passes.

Chiefs 
Completed 21 passes on 31 attempts for 209 yards and two touchdowns. As soon as the chiefs keyed on Henry and we needed tannelhill to win us the game he fell flat. (Not blaming him here, just restating that unless we are getting 200 yard on the ground against teams like the chiefs and Bill's, we aren't winning. Because he cant go out and win us playoff games.) 

Ravens
Tannehill threw for 165 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. The orginal tannelhill game sealing interception that got blamed on everyone but him. Yes the receiver fell down, yes I guess that was his first read. Who gives a fuck. AJ was eating that cbs dinner and was running wide the fuck open. Dudes awareness in the playoffs is just awful. 

Tbh I would attribute lack of awareness to basically all 3 of his pics vs the Bengals.(220 with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions) Not saying play calling isnt the problem. Idn probably but I do remember this sub being general happy with Todd before this game.. same with Auther before the ravens game🤔. And man it's so discouraging watching burrow have cat and mouse games with our defense. Changing shit based on looks. Meanwhile tannelhill is just like, "" Well this is the play that's where Ima going throw it hope hes open."" Hes just seems stuck on auto in the playoffs. 

I would use his horrible win-and-get-in games that he had as a dolphin. His 3 interception cotton ball game. His stupid fucking meltdown vs Texas that ruined my Thanksgiving. But hes gotten so much better from college that it doesn't seem fair to compare and I didn't watch him as a dolphin so I can only take their word for it. I mean i believe it.


TLDR
Us tannelhill haters aren't using just this last game to say tannelhill is more than likely gona keep us from winning a super bowl. This dude has a long history of just not being present in the biggest games. No a week 7 win verses a elite team isn't the biggest game. A week 16 win-and-get-in game with the season on the line is. Sorry we dont have any answers. Trading him away is more than likely gona be stupid. But sorry we dont think 3 OC in 3 seasons is the best idea either. Like that's even a possibility with vrabel given his history so far. Sure there may be the mastermind oc that can scheme receivers open constantly and have no bad calls but I wouldn't hold my breath.",JanMichaelVincentZ19,2022-02-02 18:54:01,"[('coaching and management', -0.25), ('team performance', -0.06)]"

1549,zt84od,I wouldn't be surprised if the Colts were to take a shot at trying to get Zach Wilson next year.,"Because the Colts have simply refused to draft a first round QB since Luck retired. They've been relying on old aged QBs like Rivers and Matt Ryan, and completely blew up their relationship with Carson Wentz. If the Jets do want to move on from Zach Wilson and maybe try to go forward with Mike White as the starting QB, then the Colts should automatically be in the front running to wanna claim Zach Wilson. I'm not sure if Matt Ryan is gonna be back next year for the Colts, but I can see Zach Wilson sitting on the bench watching him. 

I know a lot of Titans fans enjoy the misery of the Colts and their QB situation for the past three years, but I'm just saying this is an all likely scenario that could happen if Wilson is out of New Jersey.",Officer_Zack,2022-12-23 06:12:28,"[('team performance', -0.15), ('coaching and management', 0.08), ('media coverage', -0.2)]"

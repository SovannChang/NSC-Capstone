21,15vnyhv,"Whatever happens tonight, I just want to say I‚Äôm really proud of this team","Title says it all.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people who are thoroughly expecting a Miami win.  It‚Äôs understandable; after all, they‚Äôve got the best player of all time in their squad.  That said, let‚Äôs take a look back at how we got here.

We beat Colorado 2-1 and lost 4-3 to Toluca.  We beat Cincy, the current Supporters Shield leaders, in a penalty shootout.  We were down and out vs Club America, but the team still rallied, and after an absolutely farcical penalty shootout, we pulled through.  We thumped Minnesota.  We put on a resilient performance vs Monterrey.  We had, arguably, the tougher path to the final, as opposed to our opposition, who nearly lost it all to FC Dallas.

I‚Äôve been mentally preparing myself for all sorts of scenarios, including Miami being up 4-0 at the half and the match essentially being over.  However, I think what‚Äôs more likely is that we‚Äôre going to impress a lot of people who have never seen us play before, and may not have even heard of us.

Tonight, let‚Äôs show up and show out for the Boys In Gold.  Let‚Äôs sing at the top of our lungs the whole time.  Let‚Äôs give Messi an actual fight.

See you all at Geodis tonight! COYBIG üíôüíõ",OhShitItsSeth,2023-08-19 18:40:54,"[('team performance', 0.37), ('stadium amenities', 0.07), ('stadium atmosphere', -0.2), ('pricing', -0.13), ('media coverage', -0.07)]"

30,15wcncx,Thoughts after sleeping on it‚Ä¶,"1) our defense was spectacular. We gave Messi 2 looks all game (granted he almost converted both) but otherwise we took him out of the game
2) the key moment of the game for us was the 2 on 1 with Sam and Hany that we didn‚Äôt convert.  We should have, and then it would have been game over. 
3) Miami should have gotten a red for taking out Hany on a fast break in the 89th minute. And that would have had a real effect on PKs at the end. 
4) while it doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense putting Leal in the top 5 in pk since he‚Äôs been hurt and isn‚Äôt the best at PKs, in doing so it gave us a margin of error in case he missed (which he did as we know). It gave panicco 3 more chances to block one of theirs.  If we saved Leal to the 1 on 1 round panicco would have had to save theirs immediately.  Maybe it was a smart move in hindsight. 
5) I think our offense is much more complete with Sam, but it may be at Hanys expense.  Not that that‚Äôs bad overall, but will be interesting to see how Hany adjusts to not being our only option.  I don‚Äôt think he has yet, but I‚Äôm sure he will.  It will take a hit on his stats though. 
6) real questions exist around our goalie. Is Joe our guy and we just put panicco in cause Joe was out a week? Or has panicco earned the spot? Remember last year Joe got benched for performance reasons so he may not be the golden child with the coaches. Will be interesting to see‚Ä¶
7) the boys beat and played with the best on this continent.  I think we have every reason to believe they can run the table for this last stretch of the mls season.

93,tysqdy,Stop asking for parking!!!,"I swear most of you have no vision for how much better the city could be with better transit options. Instead of wasting more land to build expensive parking spots that will remain empty most of the time, y‚Äôall should be asking them to invest that money into game day buses/shuttles to Nashville neighborhoods. It would be more efficient and reduce congestion. And leave parking open to the people that actually need it‚Äîthose who are disabled, elderly, pregnant, or have very young kids. 

Infrastructure should be for people to enjoy, not cars. Parking spots cost a minimum of $10k PER SPACE to build, and that cost goes up significantly for garages. We will NEVER be able to build enough parking spots (or road lanes) to support everyone driving. If it was possible, other cities would have already done it. We should think about real solutions instead. I promise there are other options that would make the game day experience better for everyone, but if y‚Äôall only ever ask for parking we will never have better options.",genericplants,2022-04-08 02:01:59,"[('stadium amenities', 0.17), ('stadium atmosphere', -0.13), ('pricing', -0.22), ('miscellaneous', -0.12)]"

185,11p5c9p,Taylor Washington is the paragon of human virtue.,"Taylor is the paragon of human virtue without equal past or present, he is most resplendent in love, tributes and accolades. Waking or sleeping, I must not forget Taylor‚Äôs great boon and in order to return his favor by day and by night, I should only think of fulfilling my loyalty.

Who is Taylor? For the blind, he is their vision. For the deaf, he is their music. For the mute, he is their voice. For the anosmiac, he is their aroma. For the numb, he is their feeling. For the atrophied, he is their muscle. For the starved, he is their sustenance. For the thirsty, he is their water. For the exhausted, he is their energy. For the depressed, he is their happiness. For the disillusioned, he is their hope. For the pessimistic, he is their optimism. For the disadvantaged, he is their champion. For the marginalised, he is their justice. For the oppressed, he is their salvation. For the righteous, he is their symbol. For the enlightened, he is their muse. For the erudite, he is their education.

If Taylor has a million fans, I am one of them. If Taylor has a thousand fans, I am one of them. If Taylor has a hundred fans, I am one of them. If Taylor has ten fans, I am one of them. If Taylor has only one fan, that is me. If Taylor has no fans, I no longer exist. If the whole universe is for Taylor, then I am for the whole universe. If the whole universe is against Taylor, then I am against the whole universe. I will love, cherish, and protect Taylor until my very last breath; my successors will love, cherish and protect Taylor until their very last breath.",theBarnDawg,2023-03-12 04:36:27,"[('miscellaneous', 1.0)]"

288,122p2tq,A Triad of Low Ambition,"1. A cheap ownership more concerned with looking the part for the sake of ""vibes"" and stadium experience without actually investing to make their product worthwhile and able to truly compete. This club loves making more of a big deal of a shirt collaboration or whichever random celebrity has signed on for an insignificant amount of ownership than doing what's necessary to challenge the rest of the league that is continuously getting better and supported with more resources (including clubs from similar sized markets and level of recognition).

2. A general manager keen on playing moneyball in a league systematically designed to maintain parity to the nth degree (already in favor of the cheap clubs). This isn't helped with an over-reliance on cap-friendly journeymen and veterans who are literally falling apart before our eyes, along with a, becoming more often than not, poor record of international signings in general.

3. A coach whose staunch tactics are meant to be safe (and because of that, friendly to cheap ownership) but not much else with limited ability to develop much on top of that besides ""pass to Hany and inshallah."" Tactics like that could've worked in MLS 13 years ago when he won, and even then, it was a stretch.


All three of these together makes us seem like a team from a bygone era of the league when there have been other teams (owners, management, coaches) in the time before, during, and after NSC's debut who are pushing their clubs and the league forward. We feel like an MLS 1.5-2.0 club if being generous.",Zheguez,2023-03-26 15:04:55,"[('coaching and management', -0.1), ('pricing', -0.15), ('team performance', -0.04), ('stadium atmosphere', 0.13)]"

Surridge is definitely not 100%. Guy could barley jump for 50/50 balls. Surprised he played the full 90. 

MacNaughton has been huge. So just imagine how much better we will be in the back when Zimmerman is back. 

Leal seems to be creeping back into form. 

Looks like Hany and Shaffelburg are getting a bit gassed/frustrated/off-sync. A long break may do them well. Shaq on the other hand has been a consistent threat.

https://preview.redd.it/3ab3v8rtt7fa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5dcbe4280393dff67d3de5f3e2b31de7e28281b

As expected, Hany Mukhtar wins the final! The final tally was Hany Mukhtar- 273 vs Walker Zimmerman - 93. If I'm being honest, I thought the final would be closer and it probably would have been before the World Cup. Zimmerman did not have a great tournament, or a great showing during a USMNT friendly just last week. Still, he's already an all time great for Nashville SC and has the potential to win another MLS Defender of the Year.

Hany was the runaway favorite since the beginning, and I know some people thought it was pointless to have a tournament in the first place since these were the top two guys but I enjoyed thinking about my favorite (or least favorite) memories of all of these players during their individual matchups. 

In hindsight, I would have seeded a few guys differently. Teal was too high, Washington was too low. But hey, maybe in a few years we'll do another version of this. Plus, some of y'all were clamoring for some more USL players. I want to spend some time to get familiar with the history of the club before their MLS days, that's just not knowledge I have right now. Not promising anything, plus it would be redundant to have a tournament again so quickly, but if this was ever done again it's clear that it should be done by someone who knows the club's history, ALL of it.

Some data to round out this post, the largest margin of victory for any matchup was Hany Mukhtar winning 97.4% of the vote against Dave Romney in the quarterfinal. The closest race was between Joe Willis and Randall Leal, with Joe winning just 50.8% of the vote. That one was decided by just five votes! I also counted up the number of votes of the entire tournament and although I know this is not the number of individual voters, 5,705 votes were cast throughout this tournament. So I just want to say one final thank you, for participating, for feedback, and for making this a fun way to spend a pretty quiet offseason. We're less than a month away from matchday 1, and I'm excited to see the boys in gold for season 4.

408,17qoz5z,Let's Play GM,"This is a non Gary discussion. I want him gone, but I know the FO won't do it this offseason. So let's talk about who is on the roster currently. Who do we keep? Who needs to go immediately? Who needs to be phased out? We'll talk about only guys who play a fair amount.

Joe Willis (35), $375k- he's an average GK for this league. You can expect a few years more of the same level, but his contract does expire this season. I say let him walk and keep panicco ($89k) who can do a similar job for much cheaper.

Dan Lovitz (32), $551k- I think he is rapidly approaching a cliff. His passing quality dropped a lot this year, and he was prone to a few baffling defensive errors. His left footed corner kicks are valuable, but how much can you pay for that given regression elsewhere. If he's willing to take a significant pay cut, bring him back, otherwise show him the door.

Walker Zimmerman (30), DP- He is still a great defender for this league, but he is regressing. The next chance you get to buy down his DP status, do so.

Lukas Macnaughton (28), $85k- He is a solid 3rd option/starter when needed. Due for a modest raise, but he can be great depth at a reasonable price for a long time.

Jack Maher (24), $260k- He is a solid defender, doesn't offer as much on set pieces as Walker or Mac though. He'll be due for a modest raise. Keep him at a reasonable salary.

Shaq Moore (27), $725k- He is a solid defender, and decent in the build up. He is under contract for 2 more years, so you keep him, but we should expect more from him given his salary.

Anibal Godoy (33), $750k- His age has caught him. He can possess the ball reasonably well, but passing and speed are greatly diminished. Significant pay cut or let him go.

Dax McCarty (36), $275k- If he wants to come back, let him. There is still a role for him, it's not every game starter, but he can bring value. If he will play for cheaper, even better, but $275k is not bad for a veteran depth piece.

Sean Davis (30), $825k- He really fell out of favor 2nd half of this season. He is under contract for one more season. I don't think we really have any other option but to keep him and hope he re-finds better form. You probably can't keep him after this season at that salary.

Alex Muyl (28), $500k- I think he has value as a utility player. A guy who can start in multiple positions in a pinch. Keep him, but bring in enough players that he doesn't have to be a starter.

Randall Leal (26), $1.1M- His body is not cooperating with him. I can't believe he's only 26. You can't keep him at his current salary. If he is willing, cut it in half at the least and you can keep him. Otherwise there's just too much risk.

Fafa Picault (32) $650k- Decent production for his salary. If you can bring him back for similar, do it.

Jacob Shaffelburg (23), $195k- Solid, young and still improving, under contract.

Hany Mukhtar (28), DP- Keep obviously, but there is a world where the team regresses even more next year and you are forced to decide to sell high or not.

Sam Surridge (25), DP- The quality is obvious, but we need to build the team around his strengths. We are not currently built in such a way.

Teal Bunbury (33), $470k- This is not a bad price for a backup striker. Evaluate the market to see if there is a better option. If there is, great. Otherwise it wouldn't be the worst thing to bring him back.

Fringe players/backups- We desperately need more here. There's really only 2 players: Anunga and washington you can even consider putting into a real game. And when you do you just hope they don't make a critical error. All other players we need upgrades desperately.

NSC is still a new club but still no ¬´¬†named¬†¬ª regional rivalries, we‚Äôve yet to play any Tennessee club in US Open Cup and those will be rare. 

I know a lot of folks mentioned Cincinnati but here‚Äôs why I think Atlanta United should be our main rivals.

1. Atlanta United ¬´¬†southern derby¬†¬ª , on their official website they listed regional rivals as Charlotte and NSC to their schedule. Their fans also comes by huge numbers when we host them which is awesome to create some rivalry. Kinda like Club America but more local. Since they officially announced us as regional rivals, should we not officially toy with them and get a rivalry started? 

2. Cincinnati FC this one was obvious at first and officially we tried to create a rivalry but they denied seeing it as a rivalry, they already have rivalries with two Ohio clubs so they treat us as a normal game. Maybe one day we will have a Kentucky club like Louisville that we can forget about Ohio altogether.

3. Other Potential rivals - Charlotte FC and St Louis City FC are both new clubs who don‚Äôt have rivalries either, both are 5hr drive so not so bad for travelling fans. Could have mentioned Columbus but since Cincy does not see us as rivals then that won‚Äôt happen.

So here's my question -- he JUST turned 3 (his birthday is last week) and based on my experience with other sporting events he's attended, a couple of predators games and a sounds game -- he insists on sitting on a lap anyway.  If we wanted to try to pass him off as two, which visually isn't hard to do, is there any kind of validation required, or are they just going to take my word for it?

627,14kghwq,slight frustration,"Overall, I think MJ has done a fantastic job building this team, I even like the Loba and especially Piniero signings and I believe GS simply didn't know how to use them properly ( and Piniero had some other issues going on with culture shock as well, if I remember correctly), but its really frustrating that we haven't just signed at *least* one striker and midfielder on non-DP contracts last winter and again this summer. I assume we are getting a DP striker, but that shouldn't be stopping us from replacing Zubak and upgrading Teal as well. There have been options available and other teams are making signings there. GS is simply way too stubborn and slow about incorporating players into the lineup to the point that it makes no sense, IMO. he coaches out of fear and ""not to lose,"" which has been successful in terms of navigating us into the playoffs, but that isnt' a recipe for silverware once we get there. There is absolutely no reason not to have made a striker signing and even brought up some HCFC guys to get minutes at this point. I mean even when we are at full strength with Teal up top, it isnt' like he is a difference maker, we could easily audition people or drop someone else in with little practice and not see much of a drop off even if they were a worse player considering all we ask Teal to do is stand around up top and attempt to back into guys to hold the ball and pass it back, or jsut stand up there and hope the asinine long ball bounces through 2 defenders and he's able to corral it long enough to pass it into the corner to shaq who we ask to subsequently dribble deeper until he is completely cut off from the attack and try to bounce it off a defender for a corner.",snashboot,2023-06-27 15:17:05,"[('team performance', -0.6), ('coaching and management', -0.21)]"

750,12o8cfg,what GS tactics would we like to see change?,"We talk a lot about something changing around here but rarely dive into what specifically should. So I was curious on everyone's thoughts on that. 

One tactic I would love to see changed, especially since our propensity for dribbling to the corner and crossing is so well known at this point ( and no longer working), is to stop having all of our attacking players run forward in a line when we get the ball down on the wings waiting for a cross, and ( along with moving Hany back to midfield) having midfielders ( like Hany) drift back wards, or running late into the top of the box for a cut back pass to feet rather than our traditional cross. Thats exactly how Hany got his goal last night and that setup creates a much better chance for a quality shot rather than just putting it into the box for a 50/50 ( at best) ball, especially when teams know thats all we know how to do on offense. In addition to this top of the 18 tactic, as teams begin to become aware of that, the next phase would be having Hany or another attacker ( or a wingback like Moore), drift out in support of the player who has dribbled into the corner so that, rather than cross it, the can combine for a 1-2...and *then* still have that late run to the top of the 18 for a shot, or at least the quick passing from the corner will allow for the other attackers that have made their runs into the box the ability to make shifty movements to get open for more quick, tight passing in and around the 18 to open things up, rather than the very static and tired cross after cross or just hope for a corner that we do.",oldboot,2023-04-16 13:23:00,"[('team performance', 0.18), ('coaching and management', -0.21)]"

809,11vbrxj,Serious Question - You Suck,"A question of pure ignorance, I‚Äôm not trying to troll, but simply trying to understand. Why does the SS lead a ‚Äúyou suck, it‚Äôs all your fault‚Äù chant? I could care less about the away players‚Äô feelings but it‚Äôs a chant that doesn‚Äôt get used in any other pro soccer setting (to my knowledge) and for anyone that has played soccer (or hockey) it‚Äôs generally understood that it‚Äôs not usually the GK‚Äôs ‚Äúfault‚Äù in the first place. If these chants aren‚Äôt a good look for us as a fan base and really don‚Äôt have a place in pro soccer, yet they persist. Why?

Edit: this appears to be a sensitive question! Others I‚Äôve spoken with have brought up a good point though ‚Äî in American football terms it‚Äôd be the same as razzing a WR for an interception that was thrown into triple coverage by the QB. Not the WR‚Äôs fault so the crowd giving him heat for it would be kinda dumb. Right?

I‚Äôm all for a good time and making Geodis a tough place to play but seems like away players that laugh at the chant are probably laughing at us, not with us lol.",yankeecartel,2023-03-19 04:53:15,"[('stadium atmosphere', 0.23), ('miscellaneous', -0.33)]"

818,11qoj4m,Roses for Gary After Three Weeks," I probably defend Gary more than most folks around here but after just three weeks the Boys in Black (Gold if we ever wear it again) are looking sharp. Winning the home opener without starting Mukhtar was something that,if asked before the game, most would agree asked a lot of a questionable front line while also sporting Leal freshly playing the 10.
 Then traveling to New York and getting a draw. Making that second game as big a point as it was to have watched it. 
 The return home asked a bit more of our beloved Yotes/strings/etc on a cold rainy night under the Geodis Lights. Our club from the neighborly neighbors of the north were controlled thought the 90 and the Castle seems a fortress once more. 

 Flowery language aside Gary has found his offense finally and it's not going to be the beautiful game of possession and progression. Instead he's finally finding some goals and chances playing his defensive game while employing a blistering counter on the wings and a focal point capable of winning headers/playing the ball on to runners.  Gary is finally showing what his system CAN look like and for that he deserves some love. Now to take this attacking form on the road to the Rev and go to 10 in 12. #COYBIG

Ps. Fafa deserves a home goal and I hope I'm there to see it.",Occular-Stress,2023-03-13 22:45:49,"[('team performance', -0.03), ('coaching and management', 0.07)]"

I know it hasn't started yet, but I hope we go for it in this comp. I was disappointed we missed out on USOC semi and final hosting chances last year.

847,11dhfsi,Was I wrong or was this false hope?,"Like many, I spent most of last season and all of the off season spouting my many issues with the way Gary set up the team and the choice of players he often chose to field. From not utilizing Loba correctly (IMO) to heavily depending on Hany I was sure this season was going to be filled with all the same issues as last season. But I was... wrong? I know it's just one match, but the team played with a breath of fresh air we only saw on the best occasions last season... and without Hany for 70 odd minutes. Shaffleburg was excellent on and off the ball and looked extremely comfortable, Fafa with an incredible debut, Godoy and Davis setting up very strong together, the whole backline moving fluidly and working together. The team played positively and seemed to work really well in transition (which was one of the biggest issues for the team last season imo). The boys also stayed on the front foot AFTER opening the scoring which is not something we could often say last season. And then when Hany came on... my goodness. The link up play potential he will have if he isn't being constantly relied on to score will be limitless. If you go back and watch the 2nd goal, when Hany gets on the ball 4-5 NYCFC players all turn to him and completely forget about Shaff, setting up the easy goal for him. Set pieces looked good and the defense seems just as strong as ever, with Joe making some great saves as well. 

Now I won't act like it was a perfect match. I thought Leal was decent at best and Teal was fine but no where near the level of a No. 9 in this league (think Loba would have been wonderful with Shaff and Fafa beside him and Hany behind him). A few quick mistakes in the back led to some solid chances for NYCFC but nothing terrible. 

But overall setting up in the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 was superb and perfect for this team as opposed to the pseudo 4-4-2 we often played last season. Hany playing in that advanced midfield/playmaker role with great pieces around him is perfect for his profile and he could bag more assists than goals this season. (My heart wants him to be prime Ozil)

&#x200B;

So, was this just one game? Or has Gary actually fixed the issues that plagued us last season? I'm a cynical sports fan at heart and have been outspoken against Gary, but something seemed different on the pitch this weekend.",Supahot28,2023-02-27 17:28:31,"[('team performance', 0.45), ('miscellaneous', 0.05)]"

As the situation has gotten less certain, I've looked more and more into WeGo, but I'm concerned about getting out of the area after the matches.

So, does anyone have experience going to and from matches on WeGo buses?  In particular, does Metro deploy more buses for busy times?  Has anyone had to wait a long time to get onto a bus?

898,11023p5,NSC on TV,"Looking at the Nashville SC website I see the first three matches are free on Apple TV and there's a free game on Fox in April. Other than a couple other matches on cable FS1, the rest of the season is subscription only with MLS Season Pass. 

That's not only big disappointment and a disservice to the fans, it will also stunt the league's growth. I know last season's live streams and over-the-air broadcasts weren't perfect and left out many fans, but at least they were free. I also know that MLS Season Pass is a good deal for the superfans who like to watch a lot of MLS. But this is really bad for the more casual fans who might only watch a few matches here and there. And the price might be reasonable for the middle class, many people unfortunately have little or no disposable income.   

I know sports aren't free to produce, but I feel cheated that I have to pay for a full-league streaming package when I only want to watch one team.

903,10y1uze,Looking for people to hang out with (and potentially make friends?)!," Hellloooo,

So I've moved to Nashville last weekend (Midtown area) for work as a water engineer. I was an international student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (I-L-L!) and have only resided in Illinois throughout my stay in the US before graduating last December. I like what I've seen in Nashville thus far (which is of course the touristy stuff. Yes I mean, Broadway avenue \[side note: I love classic rock and almost paid 30 bucks to enjoy a live performance of whole lotta love there\] and ofc Hattie B's :)).

I am looking for people of around my age (24 y/o guy myself) to chill with on the weekends or evenings on a weekday. I like watching and playing most sports (will see the super bowl game itself and not just the halftime show this time) and it is soccer (the real football) which I follow the most (rooting for man city's downfall lmao). I love going on hikes and camping in national/state parks/reserves/forests in the US (need a nature break at least once a month tbh). I was able to see a family of black bears when I visited Tennessee's very own Great Smoky Mountains National Park last fall (after failing miserably at the Rocky Mountains).

I plan on staying in and discovering the Music City and would love some good company in doing so. Please feel free to reply on this post and connect w/ me if you or your group of friends are hanging out and have a vacant stool at a sports bar/a seat at a bonfire in a camping site/a spot in the badminton court or soccer team in one of these days!",EmphasisJazzlike151,2023-02-09 18:19:52,"[('miscellaneous', 0.05)]"

And we've made it to the final! Today is the big one, I first want to say thank you for participating and making the offseason go by quicker because of this bracket. I hope you all felt the same way.

But now it's time to introduce our finalists (although they need no introduction)! On one side is Hany Mukhtar, the two-time MLS MVP finalist and your reigning MLS MVP! His opponent, Walker Zimmerman, the USMNT alumni and two-time MLS defender of the year! They were the 1-seeds for a reason, now they face off in the finals! 

I will keep the poll for this matchup open all weekend and post the results on Monday. Happy voting!

Also, if Nashville gets an MLB club, they should name it the Nashville Brigadiers (an ode to Francis Nash, the man the city was named after and also related to the Vanderbilt Commodores)

Hi everyone! I've seen this trend on a few other subs and wanted to try it out here! This is a tournament to decide who is the all-time fan favorite NSC player! We're three seasons in now, so we've seen a fair amount of players come into the club, and a handful go out. This bracket has players that are both still on the roster, and a few that have already moved on from the club. Also, I'm sorry if the seeding isn't something you agree with, or if I missed a player. These were the players I thought were most representative of the club's past as well as its current state.

There will be one matchup every single day until a winner is decided! The polling will be open from the beginning of the day until midnight, and I'll post the results the next morning. Tomorrow will be our first matchup between #8 Taylor Washington and #9 Jacob Shaffelburg! I hope everyone enjoys this little tournament as an attempt to hold us over to the beginning of the season!",12sammy2,2022-12-27 19:32:39,"[('miscellaneous', 0.23)]"

993,y48aus,A complaint from a casual fan,"I am a fan of all Tennessee sports. I consider myself a huge Vols, Titans, Preds, and Grizzlies fan. I just started keeping up with Nashville SC this year. I‚Äôve watched several games, check the outcome of every game, and have been watching the standings closely as the playoffs drew nearer. I was hopeful for the chance to go to a home playoff game, but nonetheless excited to watch our club on tv play LA. 

I am utterly dumbfounded the MLS scheduled this game 30 minutes before the Tennessee vs Alabama game. I wonder truly how many viewers have been lost due to this blunder. It‚Äôs so disappointing that one of the best opportunities to grow the fanbase to casual viewers has been utterly squandered because they‚Äôll be watching college football instead. Is this the sort of foresight we can expect from the MLS going forward?

Edit: Some really objective responses here that make sense and that I appreciate. I still wish the games were at different times but it makes sense

We should have our PA announcer ‚Äúhype up‚Äù the crowd by starting one of Chants that the supporter section is doing, joining the supporter section, or even something as simple as after a goal having the crowd finish a phrase he/she says. I‚Äôve noticed that GEODIS isn‚Äôt always as loud as it should be during most points in a match(except when we score a goal obviously). I think it would add to the atmosphere of the stadium, engage more of the crowd, and in turn motivate the players just that tad bit more. I know this isn‚Äôt totally common in America outside of the NBA(PA saying ‚Äúdefense‚Äù), but I‚Äôd like to think we could always be a little more intimidating as a crowd, and I think this is a good way to start.

Has there been any scuttlebutt locally about moving the kickoff time of the Vancouver Nashville match on July 30?

Seems like WWE starts at 630 and Nashville SC kickoff is 700.

There might not be the biggest crossover in audiences, but fan or not the WWE event is gonna be a big deal and a big draw.

However, the thing I came here to say, we so desperately need to get back into the East ASAP!!!! The natural developing rivalries we had brewing are to hard to ignore!! Feel like it was a huge mistake and very unfair to move us to the west. if the plan is to eventually move us back, they shoulda made Charlotte bite the bullet for a year in the west, then move them to the east with st. Louis joining the west, and most likely Vegas rounding out the west evenly.

* There's a lot of jersey colors. Is there any decorum on what to wear? What's the preferred colors? Is it possible to wear one color to a different kit game or is that tacky?
* Is it poser to get a jersey? I don't know the team 100% yet but I'm all in.
* **How does customization work on the in store bought (like process)?**
* **How does customization work on jerseys bought elsewhere (dicks, authority sports, ebay)? Is it even possible?**

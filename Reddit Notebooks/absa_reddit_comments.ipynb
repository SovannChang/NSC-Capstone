      "T: Comment Text: I’m a bit worried about Surridge. Seems like there is not a lot of chemistry between him and the other guys. Any time he’s making a break we seem to find ANYONE else to try to pass to. Still early-ish all things considered, but you’d think we’d be seeing some evidence of link up play with the rest of the squad\n",
      "R: Comment Text: That's because Gary doesn't know what to do with strikers.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I agree, but he’s clearly talented and solid it’s just like they don’t know how to play together.\n",
      "T: Comment Text: I dont get why every player on the pitch is so sluggish. No one anticipates, no one reacts to a 2nd ball, no one controls the ball well…\n",
      "T: Comment Text: My small brain analysis is that we need to just take shots and try to get some other guys in position. They are covering Hany well down deep\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Is not that small brain lol. Our guys simply don’t take shots. Bunbury, no matter how open he is won’t shoot until someone is there to block it. Hany has been dribbling before shooting too much lately. Shaff, fafa, leal, anyone else who might be shooting likewise take too long to control the ball before shooting\n",
      "R: Comment Text: It does seem like Hany has had a hard time lately.\n",

      "R: Comment Text: Leave Leal on the bench please.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: He's due for a rocket outside the 18 goal. Of our options in midfield, I take Leal over Anunga or Davis. At least Leal is attack-minded.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I love the guy, and when he's playing well, he's one of our best. I don't know if it's his injury or what but he has definitely not been playing well lately. Poor passes, failed flicks and backheels, skying shots, etc. I so want him to get back to form!\n",

      "R: Comment Text: Orlando is the best road team in MLS and it showed. Played composed, took their chance and coast to a win. Our midfield is just comically bad and I’d argue is bottom 5 in the entire league. Every week teams just walk through Godoy, Dax, Davis and Anunga and that doesn’t even include them being inept at moving the ball. If this team didn’t have Hany we’d be fighting for last place in the east.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Also 11 minutes of stoppage time and not a single shot or chance created. Shameful\n",
      "T: Comment Text: Looks on to me. They’re both behind the defense so you look at where the ball is and it looks level or even a bit ahead of the eventual goal scorer’s foot. There was a lot of officiating to be mad about from last night, but I’ve got no problems with this.\n",

I get that we get penalized a shit ton, but why do the boys let the ref get under their skin and dictate the way we play. If we don't get the calls in the first 25 minutes, we don't do well.

I do understand the ref's and your interpretation and the no-call, but my argument is that he was an active participant in the play because he was running close to the winger who first received the ball and drew defenders away from him, then scored seconds later It does not seem like an objective case. If the rulebook clearly proves me wrong, that's fine and I'm always open to learning new things (feel free to quote it if you can find it), but everything I've read and understood about it makes the definition of a \"passive\" player pretty subjective based on the circumstance. Alex Muyl was called for passive offside during Hany's first-half goal during the Monterrey game, which is ridiculous...there's no way he had any impact on the goalkeeper, and he wasn't even close to the ball. But hey, it's up to the ref.\n",

Imagine if players didn’t get to recover every play, or when they’re off the field bc the other side has the ball, etc. They would likely go down and stay down for literally 30 seconds to catch their breath and give their team a moment to recover. It’s part of the game and isn’t deserving of booing unless it’s unsportsmanlike. That’s my point.\n",

      "T: Comment Text: You make a good point though unfortunately I think this is  an significantly uphill battle seen in almost all sports, hence the negative reaction on this sub. I like to give the benefit of the doubt for players who fall down though as we've all seen, heard, or been around, the crowd generally doesn't. It's probably a bad case of groupthink which you see at any sporting event. People see anything as a possible malintentioned threat to their team's success whether it's \"refs always bias against them\" or every opposing player is diving/embellishing. What's unfortunate is that it's practically ingrained in sport-watching/fandom culture. The only times I've seen people not boo was when it was clear to everyone that the player was severely injured (i.e. paramedics and a stretcher) which is abysmal but par of course for a lot of crowds. It shouldn't happen but it's likely to continue just because of the sheer number of people who participate in it, many without even thinking.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Fair play, it’s an uphill battle. Thus the post. Nashville knew nothing about hockey 25 years ago and now there are rednecks who are knowledgeable and passionate about the support. They know the rules, some strategy and even created some culture. I would like to see the same thing happen with soccer. It starts with understanding that the clock. Doesn’t. Stop. That’s why players go down. They have no other opportunity to recover from anything, not to mention maybe they’ll get a free kick out of it. Our players do it too, which makes booing the other team when their players go down hypocritical on top of being naive/ignorant. \n",

That said, it should be clear that the man himself wasn't involved with the club, soccer in the city, and other connections to him (the opening claps and the 1st tifo) to warrant this are optimistic at best. You just don't see this kind of thing with other clubs (bar what Seattle's been up to recently). Once again, it's okay to have a black kit, and I'm fine with people being excited for it.

For example, the club commissioned Judah and The Lion for the anthem and its led to divided opinions over its appropriateness and tone. Chants though have the problem of having to be easy enough to follow while trying to be unique or clever. Most of the time the latter is thrown out either because it becomes too complicated or simply it doesn't catch on with the rest of the group. There have been dozens upon dozens of creative, unique chant suggestions recommended over the years of NSC however they usually fall flat or fade in the end cause it almost never picks up steam compared to the usual. There's a reason \"Let's go (enter sports name)\" \"defense\" and the usual soccer chants \"who are you\" \"glad all over\" etc are the type of chants that last unfortunately and it's not because people aren't trying to do things differently.\n",

It’s not that no bench players have had good games (they have) it’s that when the line up is significantly rotated (which has been rare so far, but we can’t continue on like this all year) the entire unit performs much worse. Attack becomes less incisive, defense not up to our normal drilled selves. But to me it’s less about any one individual, as Zubak and Haakenson came off the bench and played well, and much more about the fact that when the entire unit is down a few first choice guys, the entire thing sputters like a car in need of a tune up.\n",

My initial question (however in artfully) in the post was trying to look at the issue of relying on rotating the line up the way we are right now and perhaps for the first time in our short history.

The difference in quality after modest rotation shouldn’t be this dire, Gary knows and hopefully can come up with some tactical adjustments to help solve for it.

      "T: Comment Text: Do you expect us to have an entire second string line of 11 players that’s just as good as our first? That’s what it’s sounding like. We have plenty of depth. The depth’s performance relies on a few key players being on the field though, which isn’t that surprising. Wish it wasn’t the case, but from what I’ve seen, it is. Haakenson, Washington, Loba, etc need guys like Zimmerman/Romney, Dax, and Hany to really perform. When you take every single core player out, it can fall apart. Like it did. Idk wtf was up w Dax that game… it’s like he wasn’t on the field. So abnormal. I think it’s more of a matter of our regularly starting non-core players like Muyl, Maher, Davis, etc becoming confident enough to really be leaders when the core is tired. Or just, you know, not take the entire core out.\n",

    "    Content: Was always a casual fan, never a die hard. I loved going to Preds games my whole life. Always had a jersey, always scored tickets to several games a year. But something happened after 2017. I felt pushed out. All of a sudden, it was the hot ticket in town. Tickets dried up. I checked several times over the years, and tickets on the resell market were well into the hundreds for a Saturday game.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I checked out and found other things to do. Didn’t really think about it until a year ago when this guy I was next to at a concert told me he scored lower bowl Hurricanes Game 7 tickets for 200 each. Now, I know Nashville is a cool place, but it felt like the Preds priced out all the fans who were around since the 90s. Just completely disconnected from us who had been on board since day 1.\n",

Add that to how awful the NHL TV deals are and I haven’t watched as much as I planned this year. I don’t want to have to hunt every game down, and have multiple subscriptions. Oh well, I’ll always be a Preds fan. Hoping the league can course correct a bit.\n",
    "    T: We were STH for years. We stopped during the pandemic and just decided it wasn’t worth the cost anymore. The culture definitely changed over the years. While the 2017 playoffs were the high point, the 2018 season was a great atmosphere as well.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    I still enjoy going to games, but it’s definitely different.\n",
    "    T: I'm grateful for the financial stability it has brought to the franchise, but saddened that so many of us who were there during the lean years aren't able to support the team the way we used to.\n",
    "    T: I hate resell sites as much as the next guy but you can often find stubhub tickets for $15-20 a pop for weeknight games up in the upper deck which is what I usually do. It would be fun to sit closer but even sitting up high is more fun than watching on tv imo so that’s what I end up doing\n",

    "    From ~2005 to around 2018 the Bucks were rivaling the Brewers in terms of how cheap it was to get into games, at one point they were offering half season tickets for $99 on black Friday, then the fancy new arena got built, the team started winning, and all of a sudden people who previously had no interest on Basketball were flocking to the arena.\n",

      "Title: Thoughts and breakdown after the Trade\n",
      "Content: Obviously, this trade sheds light once again on the Predators’ intent to revamp this roster. As the dust settles on this trade, I want to delve into the intricacies and potential ramifications for the Predators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan Johansen, known for his mercurial performances and playmaking abilities, had been a cornerstone of the Predators’ forward line for nearly a decade. However, his inconsistency and recent injury proneness rendered him a questionable investment against his hefty $8 million per year contract. By trading Johansen away, the Predators have freed up cap space and relieved themselves of a player who failed to live up to the expectations set by his substantial salary.  \n",
      "When you look at the acquisition (if they even choose to sign him) of Alex Galchenyuk in this trade, the Predators received a former third-overall pick who has experienced both success and setbacks during his NHL career. While Galchenyuk spent the previous season in the AHL, his past achievements as a consistent near 20-goal scorer stand out. Although his role on the Predators’ roster remains uncertain, his potential utility makes him an intriguing addition if kept on. The Predators may have seen something in Galchenyuk that could contribute to their plans, or they might let him walk in free agency. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "With Johansen’s departure from the team, the Predators are poised to embrace the emergence of young talent throughout the entire roster. The likely candidate to fill the Center role is the promising Cody Glass, who showcased his improvement and skills during the previous season. Glass, at the age of 24, presents a perfect bridge piece for the team’s ongoing rebuild, with the potential to provide stability and contribute to the Predators’ offensive prowess for the foreseeable future.  \n",
      "This trade may signify the Predators’ desire to make a substantial splash in the trade market this offseason. General Manager Barry Trotz has already voiced his disinterest in this season’s free agency options, hinting at the team’s intention to utilize the newly available resources. With the freed-up cap space and an arsenal of draft picks acquired through last season’s trades, the Predators are now in an ideal position to pursue top-tier available players. Alex DeBrincat, a name linked to the Predators in recent weeks, could fit the bill, bringing much-needed offensive talent and scoring ability to the team.  \n",
      "Regardless of the team’s motivations behind this trade, Ryan Johansen’s departure will undoubtedly leave a void in Nashville. The fans and his teammates will miss his contributions on and off the ice. However, this trade represents a calculated move by the Predators to shed cap space, rejuvenate their roster, and position themselves for future success. As the NHL offseason unfolds, the Predators possess the financial flexibility and assets to make significant moves in the trade market, ensuring an intriguing and transformative period for the franchise.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "**Just curious what others think about this. Do you think this means the Preds are going after a big name in the trade market, and if so, who should they go after? Im going to miss Joey, but I'm hoping that 4 million goes to signing or trading for someone who can be dynamic on offense.** \n",

      "Comments:\n",
      "T: Comment Text: It’s important to note that Alex Galchenyuk becomes a free agent on July 1st.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Im intrigued to see if they sign him. Why trade for him if you are just going to let him walk? I understand it was a cap dump, but you could have done that for the classic \"future considerations\" from Colorado if you didn't want anything back and just wanted a simple cap dump.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: You trade for him because it’s a cap dump and you have no requirement to keep him at all. Sure, you can re-sign him if you want to, but he was a part of that trade simply bc the Avs had to send *something* and Gal is the next baby step up from nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again, this was purely a cap dump by our FO. Just getting out of half of Joey’s contract alone made it worth it.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: You are most likely correct. But something that piqued my curiosity, as I stated above, was why not just ship Joey for \"future considerations\" at that point? It probably makes no difference because you can just let Gal walk, but it might be something to keep an eye on; I wouldn't be surprised if we give him a 1-year deal.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I believe the reason is that you aren't allowed to retain salary on a future considerations deal, so the Avs traded someone they werent going to sign anyway\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Nice! Didn't know that rule. Thanks!\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I didn’t know that either. Thanks!\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Because future considerations is effectively nothing. Again, Gal is also basically nothing, so it doesn’t really matter either way.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Because we would had to buy Joey out because he’s a pylon and no one wants him\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Pylon, lmao. What a perfect analogy word to use.\n",
      "From all indications, it appears his asthmatic condition was real, and best I can remember never used that as an excuse\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, he was never mistaken for let's say Paul Kariya while skating\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I can’t believe anyone that knows anything about hockey would make this post. They are not resigning him. They are planning for years down the road after these horrible contracts and buyouts are done.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I made it obvious he might not even be part of the plan. Did you read the post? I said two or three times he might not even get signed.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I read the post. I was too harsh. Clearly it was a salary dump. Johansen has been cooked for some time. Getting nothing back and only paying 4 million a year for two years is a win. Team has to get worse to get better.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Agreed\n",
      "T: Comment Text: Making a big trade now doesn’t make a lot of sense in my opinion. That’s something that would happen if we were a piece or two away from competing for a Cup. Right now we are fighting to just make the playoffs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m more inclined to believe Trotz will try hard to move up in this draft. Maybe he will use his cap space to help that goal. We will know soon enough!\n",
      "T: Comment Text: Man, say what you will about George Plaster, but he called this one.  If the pattern continues, Duchene is next.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I understand the logic, but I doubt we do it with Duchene. You only need so much cap space. Dumping Duchene would be overkill IMO.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Agreed, plus Duchene is still a good player. Not worth 8m but a good player\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Unless we are trying to get as bad as possible to get a lottery pick.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: It might be overkill, but I believe Barry is trying to purge the room of all the fat, happy vets who cruised through most of last season, pre-injuries.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Dutchy did lead the team in goals (yes, Fil would have outpaced him if he had stayed healthier longer) last season.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: He's lead the team in goals two seasons in a row, including scoring the most goals in a single season ever for a Predator.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Fortunately or unfortunately, Duchene needs Fil healthy with a couple of outlier seasons that has alluded us since Fil been here, in order to score at will like he did 2 seasons ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a lot more to it than that, however the stats don't lie that's for sure\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Mr Obvious would say if Forsberg stayed healthy over the last 5 seasons-ish, he'd easily be a top 15 forward in all the NHL. But the ole' hindsight is 20/20 always comes into play\n",

      "Edited for multiple grammatical errors and an addendum or two\n",
      "T: Comment Text: All they got was cap space. Until we see what they do with the cap space, it remains to be seen how effective the trade was. \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s no reason to think it won’t be. They seem to have a plan. Even if there is no good player to be had, they will get something out of taking a cap dump from another team.\n",

      "R: Comment Text: So is Boyle as our 1C\n",
      "T: Comment Text: My fear would be that the JOFA line is so good because those 3 have great chemistry together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Johansen is an excellent playmaker to set up great passes and scoring attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forsberg has unreal talent and can slice and dice the opposing team which is something they have to account for when he's out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "RV is RV and will burn the shit out of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know how well they would work split up, and if moving them around removes that dynamic without increasing overall production, RIP. It's hard for me to believe that splitting them up not only maintains the current level but increases it. \n",
      "\n",
      "As others have said, the other lines need to step it because the JOFA line can't carry the team.\n",
      "T: Comment Text: If we start consistently losing more than we’re winning I’d be open to it\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Yeah that’s why I’m hesitant to suggest breaking up the one good thing we seem to have going. \n",
      "R: Comment Text: I mean what’s the worst that could happen? We lose again?\n",
      "T: Comment Text: Didn't the Avs do something like this breaking up their highly productive 1st line at one point this year? Anyone know how that worked out for them as a point of comparison?\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I thought that only lasted a game or two and it didn’t stop their skid.\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I just remember seeing people talking about it on reddit, I didn't really follow it. \n",
      "R: Comment Text: I remember something about the oilers (I think) doing this earlier this season. Not sure how it turned out but it did give me the idea.\n",
      "T: Comment Text: [deleted]\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Lack of PP and defensive lapses are definitely killing us. I was thinking this was more of a solution to teams shutting down our first line and maybe having a top line player will motivate or provide lower lines with a player that has been producing. Maybe now that Fiala and Hartman have ended their drought they will start showing up more consistently.\n",
      "T: Comment Text: god no \n",
      "T: Comment Text: I'm down for experimenting with changing a little but but the example is too dramatic. There wouldn't be much chemistry and the roles are off. And you can't put RV on 3rd line just because the rest of the team sucks. He's top 2 minimum. But I get what you're saying and agree it could be worth a shot\n",
      "R: Comment Text: Yeah the lines I used were pretty rough. I was really just trying to think of lines that might work, not necessarily in order from the top line down. \n",
      "R: Comment Text: Ah that makes sense. I'm thinking something more subtle like Filip or RV on second, giving turris someone to dish to that can finish, and promoting maybe a fiala to 1st to get his goal scoring ways back. 3rd and 4th depends how the first two do. Maybe 2nd and 3rd can switch one. Another thing to look at is the defense.... Ellis has been so bad all year, he deserves to be healthy scratched. Hopefully that'll light a fire under him or something\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I’m not sure what’s going on with Ellis, Maybe Carrier or Allard can get him back on track after sitting a couple out. \n",
      "T: Comment Text: I actually like this idea, but keep JOFA together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smurf got pushed around pretty badly last at the end of the regular season and the playoffs. I think having a responsible penalty killer like Bones or Jarnkrok on the same line as Fiala would be excellent to limit the blowback from his errors at times (I think he's been playing better lately, seriousy. I don't hate the kid but he DOES make bad errors). \n",
      "\n",
      "We are likely still not sure who Boyle works best with. Should he be with players like Grimaldi and Hartman to make up for his speed? Maybe he should be placed with Fiala or Smith and we let them rip shots since he screens the goaltender so well. Definitely an interesting topic. \n",
      "\n",
      "R: Comment Text: I would say let’s try this out on a low ranked team but they always seem to have our number. I cant wait to see Boyle find his niche. I liked the game the other night where he was on a line with Rocco.\n",
      "T: Comment Text: PP needs to improve but it’s lacking because we aren’t organized on any type of attack in any offensive situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Shoot ins are the go to strategy and then nothing materializes because our offense is predictable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Passing is sloppy. Or someone’s shooting when they need to be more patient. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our physicality is non existent. \n",
      "\n",
      "My worry is that some people are getting frustrated with their own stat lines and are taking matters into their own hands to have production for themselves and not worrying about the score of the game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just some observation on my behalf.\n",
      "T: Comment Text: Keep JOFA together, but I feel like the rest of the lines need to be mixed around until something sticks. Bonino might be the go-to guy at 2C. Other than that, it's fair game to me.\n",
